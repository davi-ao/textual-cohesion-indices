Introduction</h2><p id="p000005">A speech sound system is an essential human communication system. The study of its properties can throw light on its operation, on its relations with other cognitive abilities of human mind and on the nature of human languages. The exploration into speech production and recognition and the study of the linguistic universals&nbsp;<a name="bbr000005" href="#br000005" class="workspace-trigger">[1]</a>, <a name="bbr000010" href="#br000010" class="workspace-trigger">[2]</a>, <a name="bbr000015" href="#br000015" class="workspace-trigger">[3]</a>, <a name="bbr000020" href="#br000020" class="workspace-trigger">[4]</a> found in various languages have uncovered two linguistic properties: the talker-oriented feature, which refers to the fact that the phonemes of a speech sound system always tend to effect successful communication with the least articulation effort, and the listener-oriented feature, which refers to the requirement that the phonemes of a speech sound system be easy to perceive and discriminate. There are many speech theories addressing speech properties, including Distinctive Feature Theory&nbsp;<a name="bbr000025" href="#br000025" class="workspace-trigger">[5]</a>, Quantal Theory&nbsp;<a name="bbr000030" href="#br000030" class="workspace-trigger">[6]</a>, Dispersion Theory&nbsp;<a name="bbr000035" href="#br000035" class="workspace-trigger">[7]</a>, <a name="bbr000040" href="#br000040" class="workspace-trigger">[8]</a> and Auditory Enhancement Hypothesis&nbsp;<a name="bbr000045" href="#br000045" class="workspace-trigger">[9]</a>, <a name="bbr000050" href="#br000050" class="workspace-trigger">[10]</a>, etc.</p><p id="p000010">The speech sound system consists of rules that prescribe allowable phonemes and phoneme combinations. These phonemes organize into a consistent whole. Hence, it is better to study the phoneme properties from the perspective of this whole&nbsp;<a name="bbr000055" href="#br000055" class="workspace-trigger">[11]</a>. At the same time, the speech sound system is a communication system functioning to choose phonemes and phoneme combinations to communicate information. Therefore, the working properties of a speech sound system are also important. This paper, treating the Chinese phonemes as a coherent whole, explores into the speech sound system through a comparison between its static rules and its properties exhibited in dynamic operation.</p><p id="p000015">A language system is a network with a complex structure&nbsp;<a name="bbr000060" href="#br000060" class="workspace-trigger">[12]</a>. Many researches, which all adopt complex network approaches, have examined properties of languages at various levels, including the study of phonetic and lexical network&nbsp;<a name="bbr000065" href="#br000065" class="workspace-trigger">[13]</a>, <a name="bbr000070" href="#br000070" class="workspace-trigger">[14]</a>, <a name="bbr000075" href="#br000075" class="workspace-trigger">[15]</a>, <a name="bbr000080" href="#br000080" class="workspace-trigger">[16]</a>, <a name="bbr000085" href="#br000085" class="workspace-trigger">[17]</a>, <a name="bbr000090" href="#br000090" class="workspace-trigger">[18]</a>, the study of syntactic network&nbsp;<a name="bbr000095" href="#br000095" class="workspace-trigger">[19]</a>, <a name="bbr000100" href="#br000100" class="workspace-trigger">[20]</a>, <a name="bbr000105" href="#br000105" class="workspace-trigger">[21]</a>, <a name="bbr000110" href="#br000110" class="workspace-trigger">[22]</a>, <a name="bbr000115" href="#br000115" class="workspace-trigger">[23]</a>, <a name="bbr000120" href="#br000120" class="workspace-trigger">[24]</a>, <a name="bbr000125" href="#br000125" class="workspace-trigger">[25]</a> and the study of semantic network&nbsp;<a name="bbr000130" href="#br000130" class="workspace-trigger">[26]</a>, <a name="bbr000135" href="#br000135" class="workspace-trigger">[27]</a>, <a name="bbr000140" href="#br000140" class="workspace-trigger">[28]</a>, <a name="bbr000145" href="#br000145" class="workspace-trigger">[29]</a>. These studies have discovered many important linguistic properties. However, the study of speech sound systems by means of phonemic network is so far rather rare—another motivation of the research presented in this paper, which we hope may contribute to the understanding of human speech sound systems.</p><p id="p000020">Based on the six Chinese full phonemic networks (each comprises the entire list of Chinese phonemes) constructed in our research, we have measured, of the networks extracted from real corpora, the weighted parameters and the robustness against attacks and errors to study the dynamic properties of the speech sound system. Moreover, to examine the static properties of the speech sound system, we have also conducted a statistical study of the dictionaries concerned, and measured the degrees of the networks extracted from real corpora and the parameters of networks based on above-mentioned dictionaries. The following section is to introduce the construction of Chinese phonemic networks in our research. The third section will present the measuring and the statistical approaches employed in the research. The last section will report the results and the discussion.</p></section><section id="s000010"><h2 class="u-h3 u-margin-l-top u-margin-xs-bottom">2. Structure of phonemic network</h2><p id="p000025">A Chinese speech sound system is a hierarchy, comprising phonemes, Chinese characters (monosyllables), words (polysyllables) and sentences (polysyllables). In other words, in terms of speech, Chinese sentences comprise words, which consist of characters, which, as monosyllables, are ultimately composed of phonemes. Since Chinese characters are meaningful—in fact, many characters can stand alone as words (monosyllable words), we respectively constructed the full phonemic networks of Chinese characters (monosyllables), words (polysyllables) and sentences in order to, on the one hand, investigate the properties of speech sound systems, and on the other hand, compare the properties of speech sound systems at different linguistic levels.</p><p id="p000030">Corpus: Our research has employed four materials to construct phonemic networks: the dictionary of 7290 fundamental Chinese characters (monosyllables), the dictionary of 88&nbsp;250 commonly used words (roughly 163&nbsp;500 characters), tourism news (roughly 40&nbsp;000 characters, 3650 clauses and 6240 different words) and daily dialogues (roughly 6000 characters, 840 clauses and 1200 different words) extracted from Chinese conversation textbooks available at <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/learning_chinese/dialogue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://www.china.org.cn/learning_chinese/dialogue/</a>.</p><p id="p000035">Node: the nodes of networks are Chinese phonemes, which total 46, including 21 vowels, 2 semi-vowels and 23 consonants.</p><p id="p000040">Edge: the edges in the networks are all directed ones linking neighboring phonemes. For example, Chinese character ‘<figure class="inline-figure"><img src="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0378437110010514-fx2.jpg" height="11" alt=""></figure>’ (/kan/ sweet) is composed of 3 phonemes /k/, /a/ and /n/, which are linked by 2 directed edges: /k/-/a/ and /a/-/n/.</p><div><p id="p000045">Different choices of granularity levels in segmenting linguistic materials will produce networks at different linguistic levels and bring to these networks different amounts of edges and different node degrees, resulting in networks with different properties. We segment the linguistic materials of real text at two levels of granularity: the level of sentence and the level of word. Thus, plus the networks based on the two dictionaries, we have six phonemic networks. <a name="bf000005" href="#f000005" class="workspace-trigger">Fig.&nbsp;1</a> is a sample of phonemic networks. The graph (a) is the phonemic network of the sentence ‘<figure class="inline-figure"><img src="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0378437110010514-fx3.jpg" height="11" alt=""></figure>’ (he calls me on the telephone), (b) is the phonemic network of the words extracted from the same sentence after segmentation, and (c) is the phonemic network of the monosyllables (characters) that constitutes the sentence. For the sake of a convenient computerized editing, we adopt SAMPA (Speech Assessment Methods Phonetic Alphabet, <a href="http://www.elgin.free-online.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://www.elgin.free-online.co.uk/</a>), instead of the notations of IPA. It can be seen in this figure that the differences between (a) and (b), (b) and (c) networks lie in the fact that in the network at the level of word, neighboring boundary phonemes of adjacent words in a sentence, such as ‘<figure class="inline-figure"><img src="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0378437110010514-fx4.jpg" height="11" alt=""></figure>’ (he), ‘<figure class="inline-figure"><img src="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0378437110010514-fx5.jpg" height="11" alt=""></figure>’ (to), ‘<figure class="inline-figure"><img src="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0378437110010514-fx6.jpg" height="11" alt=""></figure>’ (me), ‘<figure class="inline-figure"><img src="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0378437110010514-fx7.jpg" height="11" alt=""></figure>’ (call) and ‘<figure class="inline-figure"><img src="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0378437110010514-fx8.jpg" height="11" alt=""></figure>’ (telephone), don’t link together, however, in the network at the level of sentence, they do; and in the network at the level of character, the neighboring boundary phonemes of adjacent characters in a word, such as ‘<figure class="inline-figure"><img src="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0378437110010514-fx9.jpg" height="10" alt=""></figure>’, ‘<figure class="inline-figure"><img src="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0378437110010514-fx10.jpg" height="11" alt=""></figure>’, don’t link together, but, in the network at the level of word, they do.

Apparently, each degree distribution besides PNUS stands normal distribution test, which means that, in the five phonemic networks of polysyllables, the peak value of degree distribution is around the mean. As the node degree increases, the amount of corresponding nodes decreases dramatically—a sign of the fact that the nodes in the five networks are homogeneous because they possess roughly the same amount of links. The PNUS stands exponential distribution test, it means that PNUS is not homogeneous.</p><div><p id="p000095">The distribution of weighted degree is measured with the same approach adopted in measuring the distribution of degree.

For any given number of nodes removed from the network, we have repeated the removing operation 3000 times to obtain an average reported in this figure. It is obvious that, as the result of similar degrees of nodes, the removal by decreasing order of degree and random removal do not bring about much different consequence, which conforms to the finding of Albert and his colleagues. Moreover, the high degree in phonemic networks also leads to, within a considerable range (roughly 40% for five polysyllable networks and around 18% for monosyllable network), virtual fixedness of the relative size of the largest connected components. However, though network diameter virtually does not change with random errors, it does increase dramatically under targeted attacks. This shows that articulation difficulties, though having no influence on the communicative capacity, do deteriorate the efficiency of phonemic networks while random noise interference actually has no influence at all on both communicative capacity and efficiency of phonemic networks.</p><p id="p000140">To make certain whether the anti-interference capacity is affected by the priority of some phonemes in the operation of speech sound systems, we have measured network diameters and the relative sizes of the largest connected components when nodes are removed by decreasing order of weighted degree.

The maximum coefficient of determination between the monosyllable network and other polysyllable networks is 0.16, which denies a linear correlation between them. Among the five polysyllable networks, the average coefficient of determination is 0.82, the maximum is 0.99 and the minimum is 0.57. The two coefficients less than 0.75 both derive from the networks extracted from dialogue corpus.</p><p id="p000210">In <a name="bt000025" href="#t000025" class="workspace-trigger">Table&nbsp;5</a>, the average coefficient of determination of weighted degree in six networks is 0.994; the maximum and the minimum coefficients are respectively 0.99 and 0.86. This means all six networks, in actual operation, show similar preference for some phonemes though, owing to different styles, different corpora and different choices of granularity levels, the linking relations among nodes (phonemes) may differ in those networks.</p><p id="p000215">In brief, all six phonemic networks exhibit similar statistical parameters. Nevertheless, their topologic structures may be different, especially the topological structure of monosyllable network, which displays tremendous difference from those of other networks. The possible reason may be that, though many Chinese characters are actually monosyllable words, the corpus based on dictionary of fundamental characters somewhat suggests a different linguistic level of analysis in comparison with other corpora. On the other hand, without exception, when these networks are in operation, only a small portion of nodes is frequently linked (used), a phenomenon pointing to a common working pattern shared by all six networks.</p></section></section><section id="s000050"><h2 class="u-h3 u-margin-l-top u-margin-xs-bottom">4. Concluding remarks</h2><p id="p000220">We have investigated the statistical parameters of six phonemic networks, the compositional structure of words and syllables and the robustness of phonemic networks against targeted attacks and random errors. Our research has obtained the following results:</p><p id="p000225"><dl class="list"><dt class="list-label">(a)</dt><dd class="list-description"><p id="p000230">In comparison with networks in other fields, phonemic networks have rather high node degrees and short average distances, which indicate high efficiency in exploiting nodes.</p></dd><dt class="list-label">(b)</dt><dd class="list-description"><p id="p000235">The degrees of phonemic networks conform to exponential distribution while the weighted degrees obey power law distribution, and vowels’ weighted degrees are higher than consonants’. These results show that in the actual operation of phonemic networks, nodes, though possessing roughly the same amount of static allowable links, are used (linked) with significantly different frequency—a conclusion supported by the evidence that vowels are used more frequently than consonant.</p></dd><dt class="list-label">(c)</dt><dd class="list-description"><p id="p000240">Phonemic networks display high robustness against both targeted attacks (articulation difficulties) and random errors (random noise interferences). Random noise interferences have virtually no influence on both communication capacity and efficiency of networks and the articulation difficulties, though causing a loss in communication efficiency, neither do harm to communication capacity of networks.</p></dd><dt class="list-label">(d)</dt><dd class="list-description"><p id="p000245">The statistical study of the dictionary of commonly used words registers the higher frequency of shorter words and syllables and the tendency that the longer a word is, the shorter the syllables composing it are.</p></dd></dl></p><p id="p000250">All these results point to the tendency of speech sound systems to promote communication efficiency and facilitate sound articulation, transmission and recognition. In other words, a human speech sound system, which has been optimized in these aspects that are essential for any communication system, is quite successful.</p><p id="p000255"><em>Discussion:</em></p><p id="p000260">Result (a) is the measurement of degrees of networks, which indicates the high efficiency of phonemic networks in exploiting phoneme nodes and reveals the structural properties of networks as well as the allowable links in a speech sound system. Result (d) comes from the statistical study of the dictionary of commonly used words, uncovering the higher frequency of shorter words and syllables and the tendency in word formation to use as few phonemes as possible; apart from that, it also signifies the homogeneity of the degrees of networks, which is the sign of the maximum entropy in phonemes employment. In short, all these properties and tendencies point to the fact that the phonemic rules of Chinese speech sound systems contribute to high communication efficiency.</p><p id="p000265">Result (b) and result (c) are concerned with the operations of speech sound systems. Result (b) points out the priority that the speech sound system gives to vowels in operation, a property that, together with the harmonic structure of vowels, facilitates speech recognition and enhance the robustness against noise interference. Result (c) reveals the high robustness of phonemic networks against serious targeted attacks and random errors. In short, the operating properties and patterns of speech sound systems make for good transmission and easy recognition.</p><p id="p000270">Briefly, when it comes to formation of words and syllables, speech sound systems put emphasis on the efficiency, while in the actual operation it attaches importance to the reliability of transmission and recognition.</p><p id="p000275">In spite of the universal existence of Least Effort Principle in human behaviors&nbsp;<a name="bbr000185" href="#br000185" class="workspace-trigger">[37]</a>, <a name="bbr000190" href="#br000190" class="workspace-trigger">[38]</a>, we have not observed, in the operation of speech sound systems, a direct evidence in favor of this principle except for the fact that high efficiency reduces the amount of phonemes needed. Before dwelling on the energy-saving properties of speech sound systems, we will first address the conditions that restrain the reduction of articulation effort in human speech communication systems.</p><p id="p000280">The study of the continuous human speech flows shows that vowels generally last longer and cost more energy than consonants, which, according to the law of conservation of energy, proves that the articulation of consonants is more energy saving. In other words, to save energy means to use as few phonemes as possible and, when this requirement is met, to use as many consonants as possible.</p><p id="p000285">As seen in preceding sections, the static rules of speech sound systems incline it to use as few phonemes as possible, a property contributing to energy saving in articulation. The dynamic operation of this system, nevertheless, presents a definite favor for vowels, which enhances the reliability of communication but goes against energy saving in articulation. To put it in another way, as far as Chinese is concerned, it is in choosing allowable phonemes and combinational rules that the Least Effort Principle, which is conducive of the reduction of time spent in articulation, plays its role. In actual operation, this principle will give way to compromise between energy saving and reliability of communication. In other words, since the Least Effort Principle has retreated from the scene at this stage, the speech sound system, with its attention shifted from energy saving to reliability, gives no priority to consonants.</p><p id="p000290">The linking capacity of phonemes is rather strong: one phoneme may link many others. It is hence not likely to predict, when one phoneme occurs, its succeeding ones. In other words, the adjacent phonemes in a sound flow are comparatively independent. This property, as the price for high efficiency, reduces the redundancy of the system, impairs its anti-interference capacity and finally lowers its reliability. The solution to this problem provided by human speech sound systems is increasing system redundancy via co-articulation. Owing to co-articulation, there is no clear boundary between adjacent phonemes in a sound flow because a phoneme always merges with both its predecessor and its successor to form a continuous stream. In this way, the actual lasting time of one phoneme is lengthened, with part of its message merged into both its predecessor and its successor. Obviously, this solution increases temporal redundancy, enhances anti-interference capacity in transmission and facilitates sound recognition.</p><p id="p000295">Easy sound recognition is consistent with high reliability in transmission because (1) it is easy to discriminate two sounds and unlikely to confuse them in transmission if they exhibit sufficient acoustic difference, and (2) since vowels carry relatively high energy and their frequency at the formant is low, they can better resist attenuation and noise interference in transmission. In brief, what makes for high reliability also contributes to sound recognition—a phenomenon resulting from the evolutionary adaptation of human auditory system to environment.</p><p id="p000300">In conclusion, the allowable phonemes and compositional rules reflect high efficiency in exploiting phonemes, which also contributes energy saving and easy recognition while the dynamic networks in actual operation present the properties of high reliability and easy recognition. In other words, high reliability, energy saving and easy recognition all make for high efficiency of speech sound systems. Therefore, the speech sound system is an efficient and effective communication system that has achieved balanced optimization in the course of evolution.</p></section></div><section id="aep-acknowledgment-id17"><h2 class="u-h3 u-margin-l-top u-margin-xs-bottom">Acknowledgements</h2><p id="p000305">We thank the referees for insightful comments.
