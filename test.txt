Linda Samels Ceballos entered Loyola Law School in Los Angeles
knowing she wanted to represent the poor. She graduated in 1995
owing $58,000 in loans.
She was about to run out of means to pay back those loans when
she took a job at the Inner City Law Center in Los Angeles, a firm
that fights slum landlords. It was there that she met Nancy
Mintie.
