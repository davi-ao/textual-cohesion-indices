Introduction</h2><p id="p0035">The architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry is a fragmented industry, with information spread between numerous, changing stakeholders, including architects, engineers, contractors, subcontractors, owners, and so forth. This is one of the reasons why Bertelsen&nbsp;<a name="bbb0010" href="#bb0010" class="workspace-trigger">[2]</a><span> describes it as a complex industry. All these stakeholders have varying levels of proficiency in digital technologies. With the advent of <a href="/topics/engineering/building-information-modeling" title="Learn more about Building Information Modeling from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">Building Information Modeling</a> (BIM) tools, these varying levels of proficiency have become more apparent. They are often referred to as levels of maturity or levels of BIM adoption in the industry, and there exist frameworks for quantifying these [</span><a name="bbb0015" href="#bb0015" class="workspace-trigger">3</a>,<a name="bbb0020" href="#bb0020" class="workspace-trigger">4</a>].</p><section id="s0010"><h3 id="st0025" class="u-h4 u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">1.1. Document exchanges at the heart of AEC project design workflows</h3><p id="p0040">Winch&nbsp;<a name="bbb0025" href="#bb0025" class="workspace-trigger">[5]</a> describes that construction project teams can, in essence, be considered as information processing systems. This definition emphasises why an unobstructed information exchange between project teams is essential – an observation which is also backed up in various analyses of the construction industry [<a name="bbb0005" href="#bb0005" class="workspace-trigger">1</a>,<a name="bbb0030" href="#bb0030" class="workspace-trigger">6</a>,<a name="bbb0035" href="#bb0035" class="workspace-trigger">7</a>]. The situation in the industry is, however, not without obstacles. Notwithstanding the significant shift towards BIM tools and digital tools in general in the construction industry, many project participants are still working in a highly document-centric manner where data is stored in a static, fragmented fashion in multiple heterogenous formats [<a name="bbb0040" href="#bb0040" class="workspace-trigger">8</a>,<a name="bbb0045" href="#bb0045" class="workspace-trigger">9</a>]. Also, BIM-based workflows are often heavily document- or model-based, as the focus is on the exchange of files for achieving interoperability (BIM Level 2 as described in the PAS 1192 Specification&nbsp;<a name="bbb0020" href="#bb0020" class="workspace-trigger">[4]</a>).</p><p id="p0045">To make matters worse, design changes occur rapidly during the design, engineering and construction phases, so substantial rework must be done. Tracking design changes becomes a complicated task as these are often only documented in meeting memos, mail correspondences, on a Post-it on the project manager's table, or solely in the memory of the project participants [<a name="bbb0045" href="#bb0045" class="workspace-trigger">[9]</a>, <a name="bbb0050" href="#bb0050" class="workspace-trigger">[10]</a>, <a name="bbb0055" href="#bb0055" class="workspace-trigger">[11]</a>]. As a result, the effects of a design change are so opaque that the consequences are hard to judge, sometimes resulting in critical after-effects, also in current BIM-based workflows. Further, substantial information losses occur each time an employee leaves the project&nbsp;<a name="bbb0060" href="#bb0060" class="workspace-trigger">[12]</a>.</p><p id="p0050">Current BIM implementations do improve matters somewhat, as data structure and standardisation challenges are addressed. However, the fact that the majority of the industry is entirely document-centric, still has quite a big impact as well. No matter how much standardisation is put into file formats and exchanges, document-centric approaches result in parsing, interpretation, serialisation and deserialisation workflows that are bound to bring about inefficiencies and errors.</p></section><section id="s0015"><h3 id="st0030" class="u-h4 u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">1.2. Shifting from the exchange of documents to the management of AEC knowledge graphs</h3><p id="p0055">Considering that most documents are simply representations of data, we focus on the following research question in this paper:<blockquote><p id="sp0125"><em>How can we effectively store design data in a structured way, allowing interrelated data to maintain their relations intact as the project progresses, without losing the history of properties' progression?</em></p></blockquote></p><p id="p0060">Recent research efforts have proposed the use of semantic web technologies to overcome the document-based attitude and enhance interoperability&nbsp;<a name="bbb0065" href="#bb0065" class="workspace-trigger">[13]</a>. One main component of the semantic web is the design of <em>ontologies</em> which are by Studer et al.&nbsp;<a name="bbb0070" href="#bb0070" class="workspace-trigger">[14]</a> defined as <em>“a formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualization.”</em> ‘ Formal’ refers to the fact that it must be machine-readable. ‘ Explicit’ means that the concepts used and the constraints on their use are explicitly defined, and ‘ Shared’ entails that it describes consensual knowledge which is accepted by a group. With this work, we investigate existing ontologies in order to satisfy the Data on the Web best practice that consists of reusing existing vocabularies where applicable&nbsp;<a name="bbb0075" href="#bb0075" class="workspace-trigger">[15]</a>. We consider what additional terminology is needed to answer the above research question, thereby providing such shared conceptualisation – this terminology, together with the project-specific assertions of a particular project, form what we in this article refer to as the <em>AEC-KG</em>.</p></section><section id="s0020"><h3 id="st0035" class="u-h4 u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">1.3. Running example: calculation of heating demands for spaces in a building</h3><p id="p0065"><span>We define a typical design task, conducted as part of a building design process that the research question can be evaluated against. The particular task is the calculation of heating demands for spaces in a building. The heating demand of a space is calculated for a steady state winter condition specified for the region in which the building is located and it has two components being (1) the <a href="/topics/engineering/infiltration" title="Learn more about infiltration from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">infiltration</a> heat loss which is constituted by the undesired ventilation through leaks, and (2) the transmission heat loss through the building envelope. The magnitude of the infiltration heat loss is dependent on the temperature difference between the air in the space and the outdoor as well as the </span><a href="/topics/engineering/ventilation-rate" title="Learn more about ventilation rate from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">ventilation rate</a><span> which is typically estimated by the engineer as a function of the space volume. The total transmission heat loss of a space is the sum of the individual building envelope segments that face the space. Each transmission heat loss is dependent on the geometric properties of the segment, the thermal properties of the particular building element and the temperature difference over the segment. During the design stages, the building's geometry occasionally changes, and this has consequences for both components of the space heat loss. Further, the resulting heating demands define the boundary conditions for the devices that heat up the spaces. These devices further constitute the boundary condition for the heating distribution system and hence all its sub-components. Therefore, this design task involves multiple information exchanges, and in a design practice with successive <a href="/topics/engineering/design-iteration" title="Learn more about design iterations from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">design iterations</a>, it is a challenge that these exchanges are not handled dynamically. As the project evolves, this leads to inconsistencies, and it becomes a labour intensive task to assess the consequences.</span></p></section><section id="s0025"><h3 id="st0040" class="u-h4 u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">1.4. Overview of the outline of the article and the main contributions</h3><p id="p0070">In this article, we will first give a brief overview of the state of the art in the use of semantic web technologies in the AEC industry along with an introduction to this topic (<a name="bs0030" href="#s0030" class="workspace-trigger">Section&nbsp;2</a>). Then, in <a name="bs0050" href="#s0050" class="workspace-trigger">Section&nbsp;3</a>, we will explain the design of the Ontology for Property Management (OPM) and give brief examples and indications of how the ontology, in combination with existing ontologies, can be used to keep track of the history, reliability and provenance of a property of some Feature of Interest (FoI). With FoIs, we refer to anything of relevance in a building to an AEC expert. This includes either spatial elements (spaces, zones, storeys), physical elements (walls, windows, heaters, sensors) or abstract elements (interfaces, systems, concepts). The core of OPM dealing with property change management was already presented in&nbsp;<a name="bbb0080" href="#bb0080" class="workspace-trigger">[16]</a>, but we extend it here also to provide terminology for describing property reliability, derived properties and calculations for formalising reasoning logic (<a name="bs0050" href="#s0050" class="workspace-trigger">Section&nbsp;3</a>). The ontology extensions for describing property reliability and calculations along with best practice modelling examples are the first and main contribution of this work. The second contribution is the specification of a standardised way to generate parametric queries for managing an OPM-compliant AEC-KG. In <a name="bs0125" href="#s0125" class="workspace-trigger">Section&nbsp;4</a>, considerations concerned with this management is discussed in detail and in <a name="bs0160" href="#s0160" class="workspace-trigger">Section&nbsp;5</a><span>, a JavaScript-based <a href="/topics/engineering/application-programming-interface" title="Learn more about Application Programming Interface from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">Application Programming Interface</a> (API) that facilitates the creation of uniform, reliable queries for retrieving, creating and updating OPM properties and calculations is presented. The API provides a crucial addition to the proposed OPM ontology. Namely, considering the expressiveness and complexity of OPM, end-user applications wishing to implement the proposed property management need a middeware that allows them to define the desired queries towards an OPM-compliant AEC-KG. The OPM Query Generator (OPM-QG) provides a reference implementation of such a middleware API. In </span><a name="bs0220" href="#s0220" class="workspace-trigger">Section&nbsp;6</a><span>, we demonstrate a <a href="/topics/engineering/proof-of-concept" title="Learn more about Proof of Concept from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">Proof of Concept</a> (PoC) open-source implementation built on top of the OPM infrastructure which assesses the practical design case described above. This software is demonstrated online with an actual building Knowledge Graph. The architecture and considerations in this regard are discussed in detail in this section.

Web ontologies for AEC knowledge graphs</h3><p id="p0080">Researchers in the linked data and semantic web domain have recently aimed at making building data available on the web, linking data rather than documents [<a name="bbb0085" href="#bb0085" class="workspace-trigger">17</a>,<a name="bbb0090" href="#bb0090" class="workspace-trigger">18</a>]. This group of researchers in the AEC domain has been gathering behind the recent initiatives around linked data in architecture and construction, which includes the Linked Data Working Group (LDWG) in buildingSMART International (bSI)<a name="bfn0010" href="#fn0010" class="workspace-trigger"><sup>1</sup></a>, and the Linked Building Data (LBD) Community Group<a name="bfn0015" href="#fn0015" class="workspace-trigger"><sup>2</sup></a> at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). In both standardisation bodies, ontologies are proposed for capturing building data using web technologies. The groups focus on the use of semantic web technologies, namely the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and the Resource Description Framework (RDF) [<a name="bbb0095" href="#bb0095" class="workspace-trigger">19</a>,<a name="bbb0100" href="#bb0100" class="workspace-trigger">20</a>], thus creating smaller aligned ontologies and putting them on a track towards standardisation. Aligned in this regard meaning that they extend or comply with terminology from the other ontologies.</p><p id="p0085">buildingSMART is the standardisation organ who maintains the standard exchange format for BIM data models: the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standardised by ISO 16739&nbsp;<a name="bbb0105" href="#bb0105" class="workspace-trigger">[21]</a>.</p><p id="p0090">The LDWG remains entirely in the buildingSMART realm, focusing mainly on the production of the ifcOWL ontology<a name="bfn0020" href="#fn0020" class="workspace-trigger"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp;<a name="bbb0110" href="#bb0110" class="workspace-trigger">[22]</a>, which was initially proposed by Beetz et al.&nbsp;<a name="bbb0115" href="#bb0115" class="workspace-trigger">[23]</a>. The ifcOWL ontology is set up to be a direct translation from the IFC schema represented in the EXPRESS data modelling language&nbsp;<a name="bbb0120" href="#bb0120" class="workspace-trigger">[24]</a> into an OWL representation. This has resulted in an extensive ontology, much unlike many of the existing ontologies in various other domains, that are typically more narrow scoped and depend on extensions enabled by linked data principles. For this reason, there have also been various attempts on simplifying this ontology. For example, Terkaj and Pauwels&nbsp;<a name="bbb0125" href="#bb0125" class="workspace-trigger">[25]</a> worked on the modularisation of this ontology. Other approaches like IFCWoD (IFC Web of Data)&nbsp;<a name="bbb0130" href="#bb0130" class="workspace-trigger">[26]</a>, SimpleBIM&nbsp;<a name="bbb0135" href="#bb0135" class="workspace-trigger">[27]</a>, and BimSPARQL&nbsp;<a name="bbb0140" href="#bb0140" class="workspace-trigger">[28]</a><span> aimed at providing simplified views over ifcOWL data. IFCWoD implements a set of rules within the triple store; SimpleBIM implements <a href="/topics/engineering/rewrite-rule" title="Learn more about rewrite rules from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">rewrite rules</a> in code; and BimSPARQL simplifies ifcOWL data by extending the query language for RDF, SPARQL&nbsp;</span><a name="bbb0145" href="#bb0145" class="workspace-trigger">[29]</a>, with rewrite rules and geometry calculation algorithms. None of the simplification approaches proposes and defines an explicit OWL ontology. The BIM Shared Ontology (BIMSO) and BIM Design Ontology (BIMDO) together constitute another modularity approach with ontologies that are designed from scratch and, therefore, have no connection to IFC. BIMSO has a minimal core and builds on the UNIFORMAT II classification system and BIMDO provides specific terminology for design&nbsp;<a name="bbb0150" href="#bb0150" class="workspace-trigger">[30]</a>. These are, unfortunately, not publicly available.</p><p id="p0095">The W3C LBD Community Group, has focused mostly on the creation of ontologies for capturing building information from close to scratch. By starting from close to scratch, ontology engineering best practices can be more easily maintained. For example, it is possible to reuse existing ontologies and develop minimal extensions in a modular fashion. This is possible because RDF uses International Resource Identifiers (IRIs) to denote resources (i.e. something in the world)&nbsp;<a name="bbb0100" href="#bb0100" class="workspace-trigger">[20]</a>. The Linked Data rules&nbsp;<a name="bbb0155" href="#bb0155" class="workspace-trigger">[31]</a> further require the use of HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) IRIs like the ones used when browsing the web, thereby making it possible to provide useful information about a resource when someone looks it up in a web browser.</p><p id="p0100">The W3C group currently focuses on the development and maintenance of a Building Topology Ontology (BOT)&nbsp;<a name="bbb0160" href="#bb0160" class="workspace-trigger">[32]</a> and demonstrating best practices for publishing building products and associated properties on the web using Linked Building Data principles.</p><p id="p0105">BOT was originally proposed by Rasmussen et al.&nbsp;<a name="bbb0165" href="#bb0165" class="workspace-trigger">[33]</a> who examined existing ontologies in the scope of buildings and found that they all redefined the same basic elements (e.g. spaces, storeys and elements) and topological relationships between these. Therefore, a minimal, extensible ontology for this sole purpose was proposed. Later it has been developed as a community effort by the W3C LBD Community Group&nbsp;<a name="bbb0160" href="#bb0160" class="workspace-trigger">[32]</a>.</p></section><section id="s0040"><h3 id="st0055" class="u-h4 u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">2.2.

The most simplistic form, direct assignment of datatype properties, reduces the complexity of the queries and thereby makes it easier to navigate the graph. Typed literals can encode information such as the unit of measure as proposed by Lefrançois and Zimmermann&nbsp;<a name="bbb0180" href="#bb0180" class="workspace-trigger">[36]</a> with the Unified Code of Units of Measures datatype. However, no additional metadata can be included.</p><p id="p0130">Rasmussen et al.&nbsp;<a name="bbb0080" href="#bb0080" class="workspace-trigger">[16]</a> describe three levels of complexity, where each level refers to the number of steps between the FoI and the actual object (literal or individual) that encodes the value of its property. L1 is equal to the approach used by SimpleBIM. L2 (used by IFCWoD and BIMDO) describes the property as an object, and thereby allows attaching metadata such as a unit of measure using a dedicated ontology like Quantities, Units, Dimensions and Types (QUDT)&nbsp;<a name="bbb0185" href="#bb0185" class="workspace-trigger">[37]</a> or provenance data using the PROV Ontology (PROV-O)&nbsp;<a name="bbb0190" href="#bb0190" class="workspace-trigger">[38]</a><span>. L3 is used by OPM and is inspired by the Smart Energy-Aware Systems (SEAS) evaluations \cite{seassisiot}, which is aligned with the joint W3C and OGC SOSA/SSN standard specifying the semantics of sensors, observations, sampling, and <a href="/topics/engineering/actuation" title="Learn more about actuation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">actuation</a> </span><a name="bbb0195" href="#bb0195" class="workspace-trigger">[39]</a>,<a name="bbb1010" href="#bb1010" class="workspace-trigger">[50]</a>,<a name="bbb1015" href="#bb1015" class="workspace-trigger">[51]</a>,<a name="bbb1020" href="#bb1020" class="workspace-trigger">[52]</a><span>.

Providing derived properties at run-time rather than materialising them in the graph has the benefit that outdated or redundant information is avoided. Zamanian and Pittman&nbsp;<a name="bbb0210" href="#bb0210" class="workspace-trigger">[42]</a>, however, argue that since AEC projects are performed by distributed teams, it is often desirable to have some consistent redundancies that are designed and managed to provide more efficient means to access and manipulate the information. Some party might wish to refer to an intermediate result of a derived property, and this is not immediately possible if that information is only described in a rule. Also, with OPM, the intention is that interdependencies are explicitly stated so that the knowledge workers are provided with insights. The initial work presented by Rasmussen et al.&nbsp;<a name="bbb0080" href="#bb0080" class="workspace-trigger">[16]</a> suggests that every state of a property is saved in order to evaluate design changes, and this is only possible when materialising reasoning results.</p></section></section><section id="s0050"><h2 id="st0065" class="u-h3 u-margin-l-top u-margin-xs-bottom">3. An Ontology for Property Management (OPM)</h2><p id="p0150">The Ontology for Property Management (OPM) was initially introduced by Rasmussen et al.&nbsp;<a name="bbb0080" href="#bb0080" class="workspace-trigger">[16]</a>. It provides terminology for modelling complex properties in a design environment. Complexity, in this regard, entails that they (1) change over time (2) can be assumptions and hence comprise varying reliability, and (3) can be dependent on the value of other properties. The first contribution demonstrated how property assignment modelled according to this ontology can be used to answer a set of competency questions that are all concerned with managing evolving properties. <a name="bs0055" href="#s0055" class="workspace-trigger">Section&nbsp;3.1</a> first overviews the concepts of the OPM ontology that was presented in the initial OPM paper. Then subsequent sections define additional sets of competency questions that deal with reliability (<a name="bs0060" href="#s0060" class="workspace-trigger">Section&nbsp;3.2</a><span>) and handling of <a href="/topics/engineering/interdependency" title="Learn more about interdependencies from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">interdependencies</a> between properties (</span><a name="bs0085" href="#s0085" class="workspace-trigger">Section&nbsp;3.3</a>). We propose a set of new concepts extending the initial version of OPM to provide terminology to answer these questions.

The level in this regard refers to <em>“the number of steps/relations between the FoI and the actual object (literal or individual) that encodes the value of its property.”</em> The most expressive level, L3, is used in OPM to capture property changes over time. It uses the concept of property evaluations from SEAS. <a name="bf0010" href="#f0010" class="workspace-trigger">Fig.&nbsp;2</a> illustrates how the <a href="https://w3id.org/opm#PropertyState" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opm:PropertyState</a> (subclass of <a href="https://w3id.org/seas/Evaluation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seas:Evaluation</a>) can be used to capture a state of a property. It is assigned to a property using the <a href="https://w3id.org/opm#hasPropertyState" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opm:hasPropertyState</a> (sub-property of <a href="https://w3id.org/seas/evaluation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seas:evaluation</a>) predicate, and the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#range" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rdfs:range</a> of this predicate implies that it belongs to the <a href="https://w3id.org/opm#PropertyState" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opm:PropertyState</a> class. OPM depends on <a href="http://schema.org/value" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">schema:value</a>, <a href="http://schema.org/minValue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">schema:minValue</a> and <a href="http://schema.org/maxValue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">schema:maxValue</a> to assign a value to a property state, and, as a minimum, the state must further have a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#generatedAtTime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prov:generatedAtTime</a> predicate. Retrieving the most recent state of a property can be achieved by querying for the highest <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#generatedAtTime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prov:generatedAtTime</a> value, but this (1) increases the query complexity and (2) reduces query performance&nbsp;<a name="bbb0080" href="#bb0080" class="workspace-trigger">[16]</a>.

As part of this work, we had discussions with industry professionals who described working methodologies that are dependent on being able to assess the quality of any data in the project.

CQ 2.1, How to describe that the value of some property is defined temporarily until the actual value is known?</h4><p id="p0255">OWL class <a href="https://w3id.org/opm#Assumed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opm:Assumed</a> In the early stages of any construction project, it is common practice to make temporary assumptions in order to progress with the design. Assumptions are typically managed in assumption lists, conducted as simple documents such as a spreadsheet, and it is the project manager's job to make sure that all assumptions are later clarified and confirmed by a person in charge of the specific domain. An assumption is thus defined here as a non-final value with a high probability of changing over time as the project evolves. Classifying a property state as <a href="https://w3id.org/opm#Assumed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opm:Assumed</a> describes that the value is temporary and must later be confirmed.

For legal documentation purposes, a <a href="/topics/engineering/electronic-document-identification-systems" title="Learn more about digital signature from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">digital signature</a> can be assigned to the property. Also, a link to documentation such as a mail, a scanned contract or similar can be attributed to the property state using the </span><a href="https://w3id.org/opm#documentation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opm:documentation</a> predicate. As it is common practice to set milestones in the course of a construction project, at which certain parameters are locked, these are obvious opportunities to mark all related object properties as confirmed. An example of a milestone is the date where the layout of the superstructure is frozen and concrete elements are ordered from the manufacturer. Changing the design after this date is possible, but it will likely lead to a cost penalty that someone needs to pay.</p></section><section id="s0075"><h4 id="st0090" class="u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">3.2.3.

A simple example is the area of a window, which is either directly deduced from its geometrical definition or by a product of the height and width properties. If the value of a property is dependent on other properties, it should have the <a href="https://w3id.org/opm#Derived" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opm:Derived</a> class applied. Keeping derived properties up to date can be automated, but in many occasions it is desirable for the engineer to keep the design as is, knowing that the property is no longer valid. Only when the consequence of the change is significant, the design is revised. It might also be that the consequences are not acceptable, and in this case, the party who made the initial change must instead be asked to revert the change. The engineer can be supported in this decision by dynamically deriving the new result while calculating the deviation from the static result. Also, it can be explicitly stated that the state belongs to the class <a href="https://w3id.org/opm#OutdatedPropertyState" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opm:OutdatedPropertyState</a>.

It is thereby possible to query the AEC-KG for all properties that do not fulfil the requirements that have been defined.

However, it was decided to make a middleware on a backend server that handles communication with a SPARQL 1.1 endpoint. The Stardog triplestore was originally used, but any other triplestore that implements the SPARQL 1.1 Protocol standard may be used instead (e.g., Jena Fuseki, RDF4J Sesame). No reasoning needs to be performed by the triplestore. In fact, the queries generated by OPM-REST <a href="/topics/engineering/application-programming-interface" title="Learn more about API from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">API</a> do contain complex constructs for OWL2 RL axioms&nbsp;</span><a name="bbb0240" href="#bb0240" class="workspace-trigger">[48]</a>. Therefore, the SPARQL engine does operate all the OWL RL inferences, which has sufficient expressivity for our needs.</p><p id="p0575">Using the OPM-REST API, the frontend application can be developed by developers with no knowledge of RDF and OPM, and they are hence protected from the complex queries demonstrated in the previous sections. This is particularly practical for tasks that require several queries to the triplestore and further entails that complicated requests can be used across several client applications.</p><p id="p0580">The backend is built as a Representational state transfer (REST) API which exposes a set of routes to which client applications can send HTTP request in order to do CRUD operations on the AEC-KG (see <a name="bs0160" href="#s0160" class="workspace-trigger">Section&nbsp;5</a>). Some of the routes are generic and will, for example, return all properties assigned to a FoI, change a class assigned to a FoI, update a property or return a full list of calculations. Others are provided for a particular application and will, for example, return all the parts of the building envelope that face a specific room.</p><p id="p0585">The frontend of both applications is built with the Angular<a name="bfn0055" href="#fn0055" class="workspace-trigger"><sup>11</sup></a> and is structured so that a service component takes care of the communication with the backend whereas a set of controllers take care of building the view based on the data returned by the service.</p><p id="p0590">In the next sections, the functionalities of OPM-REST related to OPM are described.</p></section><section id="s0230"><h3 id="st0245" class="u-h4 u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">6.2.

The architectural model is then mainly used as a geometrical reference model for the mechanical and structural design models. With this work, we suggest an approach where all the valuable information is extracted for further use, thereby relying on the set of ontologies and methods proposed within the W3C LBD Community Group. For example, using the Revit-BOT-exporter</span><a name="bfn0060" href="#fn0060" class="workspace-trigger"><sup>12</sup></a>&nbsp;<a name="bbb0245" href="#bb0245" class="workspace-trigger">[49]</a><span> with an extension for extracting the building envelope and for communicating with the REST API instead of writing triples to a file, it was possible to establish direct communication between the native BIM tool and the backend. All topological relationships and properties are extracted and sent via an OPM batch upload route to the server through this setup. A set of definitions for the <a href="/topics/engineering/graphical-programming" title="Learn more about graphical programming from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">graphical programming</a> tool Dynamo for Revit that directly communicate with OPM-REST were further developed to demonstrate how a connection to legacy models can be established.

The state of class instances and topological relationships are not managed with OPM but properties such as space names and numbers, areas, volumes, 2D space boundaries and object mesh models are. All properties are received in complexity level L1 (see <a name="bs0040" href="#s0040" class="workspace-trigger">Section&nbsp;2.2</a>), and these are loaded into a temporary named graph in the AEC-KG (see <a name="bs0150" href="#s0150" class="workspace-trigger">Section&nbsp;4.2</a>). Then, a comparison is conducted between what is already in the AEC-KG and what new properties have been received.

Conclusions and future work</h2><p id="p0660">In this article we demonstrated how semantic web technologies can be used to cope with the highly interrelated and rapidly changing design decisions when developing a construction project. We used the preliminary Ontology for Property Management (OPM)&nbsp;<a name="bbb0080" href="#bb0080" class="workspace-trigger">[16]</a><span><span>, and tripled the number of competency questions it answers to account for property reliability, and the description of how Features of Interest property values may be inter-dependent by laws of physics. We proposed an <a href="/topics/engineering/application-programming-interface" title="Learn more about API from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">API</a> to homogeneously query and manage OPM-compliant AEC Knowledge Graphs (AEC-KG). We demonstrated how these contributions can be used with an open-source and reusable </span><a href="/topics/engineering/proof-of-concept" title="Learn more about Proof of Concept from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">Proof of Concept</a> implementation. This implementation exposes the benefits of having all interconnections between project properties explicitly connected in an AEC-KG. With such traceability and consequence analysis of a property change, we demonstrated that AEC softwares, even proprietary softwares, could use semantic web technologies to better support the design engineers' decision inter-operating throughout the development of construction projects.</span></p><p id="p0665">We developed a reusable open-source implementation which can be used to store design data in a structured way, allowing interrelated data to maintain their relations intact as the project progresses. This system answers our initial research question:<blockquote><p id="sp0130"><em>How can we effectively store design data in a structured way, allowing interrelated data to maintain their relations intact as the project progresses, without losing the history of properties' progression?</em></p></blockquote></p><p id="p0670">With our proof of concept implementation, the full history of the project persists, and it is hence possible at any point in time to analyse the background of a specific design change. It was endeavoured to use terminology which is already widely adopted to describe the AEC-KG. Property inferencing is based on standard OWL reasoning, and the widely adopted ontologies PROV-O and schema.org are used for describing properties.</p><p id="p0675">The PoC shows an alternative approach for working with building data. It is a general experience in the industry that valuable data is trapped in proprietary <a href="/topics/engineering/building-information-modeling" title="Learn more about BIM from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">BIM</a> models and, with this work, we demonstrate how data from the other stakeholder's (architect's) model can be made accessible as RDF triples, directly from within the designer's tool-chain and not through an intermediate file format.</p><section id="s0270"><h3 id="st0285" class="u-h4 u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">7.1.

The intention is that calculations and inferencing, which are currently done in different tools by different people, is described explicitly and in an interoperable manner. As soon as all the arguments for a particular calculation are available, so is the result. In such a setup, the primary task of an engineer is to make sure that all arguments are provided by the other practitioners. Further, since consequence analyses can be performed much faster, the engineer could potentially work with multiple parallel concepts for each design until sufficient knowledge is available for making a final choice.</p><p id="p0685">Making calculations and hence design tasks reusable entails that the knowledge of the company as a whole grows over time in contrast to today where it is mainly the knowledge of the employees that evolves. Over time, the growing AEC-KG could potentially overcome the still existing challenge that companies lose access to large quantities of critical knowledge as employees turn over as it was implied by O’Leary&nbsp;<a name="bbb0060" href="#bb0060" class="workspace-trigger">[12]</a>.</p></section><section id="s0275"><h3 id="st0290" class="u-h4 u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">7.2. Future outlook</h3><p id="p0690">In the PoC, all calculations were performed at the backend using an approach similar to the one illustrated in <a name="bf0030" href="#f0030" class="workspace-trigger">Fig.&nbsp;6</a>. It would be interesting to investigate how some calculations could be performed by the client application while still following the OPM principles described in <a name="bs0050" href="#s0050" class="workspace-trigger">Section&nbsp;3</a><span> when writing the resulting triples to the AEC-KG. It would also be interesting to investigate how more complex calculations such as <a href="/topics/engineering/thermal-simulation" title="Learn more about thermal simulations from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">thermal simulations</a> could be implemented in practice.</span></p><p id="p0695">Future work also includes proof of concept integration of the presented work in various proprietary softwares. In fact, designers usually rely on such softwares to perform their work; for example, structural designers use analysis and design software when designing a multistory building. The approach presented in this paper is a first step towards the demonstration that Linked Data will facilitate the parallel development of various analysis over the same <a href="/topics/engineering/model-buildings" title="Learn more about building model from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">building model</a> in these different heterogeneous softwares.</p></section></section></div><section id="ac0005"><h2 id="st0295" class="u-h3 u-margin-l-top u-margin-xs-bottom">Acknowledgements</h2><p id="p0700">Special thanks to the <span id="gts0005">NIRAS ALECTIA Foundation</span> and <span id="gts0010">Innovation Fund Denmark</span> for funding.
