In ChIP-Seq methodologies, antibodies that recognizes a specific TF are used to pull down attached DNA for sequencing. The ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) consortium </span><a name="bb0035" href="#b0035" class="workspace-trigger">[7]</a> has produced vast amount of publicly available high-throughput ChIP-Seq experiments that are processed and deposited into databases such as GTRD <a name="bb0040" href="#b0040" class="workspace-trigger">[8]</a> and ChIP-Atlas <a name="bb0045" href="#b0045" class="workspace-trigger">[9]</a> (&gt;40,000 human experiments). These databases can be utilized to construct a high coverage transcriptional regulatory network. There are also other sources of transcriptional regulatory network including JASPAR <a name="bb0050" href="#b0050" class="workspace-trigger">[10]</a>, the Open Regulatory Annotation database (ORegAnno) <a name="bb0055" href="#b0055" class="workspace-trigger">[11]</a>, SwissRegulon <a name="bb0060" href="#b0060" class="workspace-trigger">[12]</a>, the Transcriptional Regulatory Element Database (TRED) <a name="bb0065" href="#b0065" class="workspace-trigger">[13]</a>, the Transcription Regulatory Regions Database (TRRD) <a name="bb0070" href="#b0070" class="workspace-trigger">[14]</a>, TFactS <a name="bb0075" href="#b0075" class="workspace-trigger">[15]</a>, TRRUST <a name="bb0080" href="#b0080" class="workspace-trigger">[16]</a>.

Overview and related works</h2><p id="p0025">Text mining plays an important role in unveiling purified information from a large number of documents in a satisfactory time. Essential steps for biomedical text mining can be divided into 3 steps: (1) information retrieval (IR), (2) name entity recognition (NER), and (3) information extraction (IE). Together, they can be utilized to identify specific biological knowledge from literature <a name="bb0105" href="#b0105" class="workspace-trigger">[21]</a>, <a name="bb0110" href="#b0110" class="workspace-trigger">[22]</a>.</p><p id="p0030">IR tools retrieve relevant text information from articles, abstracts, paragraphs, and sentences corresponding to subject of interest. A popular IR approach for biomedical application is the use of Boolean model logic (AND/OR) for extracting relevant information containing specific biological terms <a name="bb0115" href="#b0115" class="workspace-trigger">[23]</a><span>. Prominent IR tools that use the <a href="/topics/computer-science/boolean-logic" title="Learn more about Boolean logic from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">Boolean logic</a> model are iHOP </span><a name="bb0120" href="#b0120" class="workspace-trigger">[24]</a> and PubMed. PubMed utilizes human-indexed MeSH terms to reduce the search space and retrieve relevant abstracts containing user specified keywords. iHOP builds on PubMed and is able to detect co-occurrence of terms. A limitation of iHOP is that the terms must occur in the same sentence.</p><p id="p0035">After the IR step, NER must be used to identify relation between biological entities. This is a challenging step as entity names are not unique. Therefore, NER tools must take textual context into consideration to accurately detect entities. For example, gene names may have different variations in orthographical structure (e.g. ABL1, Abl1, Abl-1) or multiple synonyms (e.g. ABL1, ABL, CHDSKM, Abelson tyrosine-protein kinase 1). ER methods, typically divide the task into two steps, (1) identify the entities and their location in the context, and (2) assign unique identifiers to the entities <a name="bb0115" href="#b0115" class="workspace-trigger">[23]</a>. Fortunately, multiple terminological databases, such as Gene Ontology <a name="bb0125" href="#b0125" class="workspace-trigger">[25]</a>, UMBLS <a name="bb0130" href="#b0130" class="workspace-trigger">[26]</a>, BioLexicon <a name="bb0130" href="#b0130" class="workspace-trigger">[26]</a>, and Biothesaurus <a name="bb0130" href="#b0130" class="workspace-trigger">[26]</a> provide information on biological entities and name variations and can be used to detect biological entities such as genes or proteins <a name="bb0135" href="#b0135" class="workspace-trigger">[27]</a>, <a name="bb0140" href="#b0140" class="workspace-trigger">[28]</a>.</p><p id="p0040">Lastly, Relation Extraction (RE) is a task for extracting pre-defined facts relating to an entity or entities in the text <a name="bb0145" href="#b0145" class="workspace-trigger">[29]</a>. In biomedical domain, multiple RE methods have been developed to extract information relating to genes <a name="bb0080" href="#b0080" class="workspace-trigger">[16]</a>, such as Mutation-Disease associations, protein-protein interaction <a name="bb0150" href="#b0150" class="workspace-trigger">[30]</a>, <a name="bb0155" href="#b0155" class="workspace-trigger">[31]</a>, pathway curation <a name="bb0160" href="#b0160" class="workspace-trigger">[32]</a><span>, gene <a href="/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/methylation" title="Learn more about methylation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">methylation</a> and cancer relation </span><a name="bb0165" href="#b0165" class="workspace-trigger">[33]</a>, biomolecular events <a name="bb0170" href="#b0170" class="workspace-trigger">[34]</a>, metabolic reactions <a name="bb0175" href="#b0175" class="workspace-trigger">[35]</a> and gene-gene interactions <a name="bb0180" href="#b0180" class="workspace-trigger">[36]</a><span><span>. For <a href="/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/gene-regulatory-network" title="Learn more about gene regulatory networks from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">gene regulatory networks</a>, which is the focus of this paper, the RE system must detect and extract a </span><a href="/topics/computer-science/causal-relation" title="Learn more about causal relation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">causal relation</a> between a protein and a gene (e.g., A regulated B). This task is very complex, even for human experts </span><a name="bb0185" href="#b0185" class="workspace-trigger">[37]</a>. To illustrate, consider the causal relation <em>“aatf upregulates c-myc”</em> that should be deduced from the following sentence: <em>“down-regulation of c-myc gene was accompanied by decreased expressions of c-myc effector genes coding for htert, bcl-2, and aatf”</em> <a name="bb0190" href="#b0190" class="workspace-trigger">[38]</a>. Extracting a positive regulatory interaction between AATF and c-Myc is quite challenging using simple RE methods. For example, the RE method, may naively annotated the interaction as negative because of the keyword <em>“decreased”</em>. However, by taking <em>“down-regulation”</em> into account, the RE method would able to correctly extract a positive regulation from this sentence.</p><p id="p0045">Therefore, construction of a causal transcriptional regulatory network by traditional means of text mining is hampered by these challenges and as a result, fully automated text-mining based models are limited in their scope and accuracy <a name="bb0115" href="#b0115" class="workspace-trigger">[23]</a>. Combining experimentally derived regulatory interactions from high-throughput sources with text-mining approaches can bridge the gap between the two approaches and address their shortcomings.</p><p id="p0050">In this work, we present a hybrid model ModEx, to mine the biomedical literature in MEDLINE to extract and annotate causal transcriptional regulatory interactions derived from high-throughput ChIP-seq datasets. Our model incorporates three main components of IR, NER and IE customized for mining regulatory interactions. Several expert-generated dictionaries are provided to optimize and complement the IR component. We proposed a weighted long-range dependency graph to extract causal relations and annotated the retrieved interaction with meta-data, such as full supporting sentences, PubMed ID, and importantly mode of regulation. Our pipeline bypasses several of the challenges of fully automated text-mining methods, including query translation for a particular interaction, relevant citation retrieval, entities recognition and regulatory annotation. ModEx was able to achieve an F-score 0.76 in retrieving and annotating a gold-standard regulatory network. We also compared ModEx with a state-of-the-art method, and the result shows strong improvement in terms of <a href="/topics/computer-science/classification" title="Learn more about classification from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">classification</a> metrics.</p></section><section id="s0015"><h2 id="st015" class="u-h3 u-margin-l-top u-margin-xs-bottom">3.

ChIP-Atlas contains all publicly available high-throughput ChIP-Seq experiments. We assembled regulatory networks from these interactions using various cutoff criteria for ChIP-Seq peak signal score and distance to the TSS. The least stringent criterion results in a network with 4 million interactions between 758 TFs and 18,874 target genes. However, there is no reported mode of regulation in ChIP-Atlas.</p><p id="p0060">We used PubMed engine to query the MEDLINE database using the entities involved in interaction in ChIP-Atlas. MEDLINE is openly accessible and provides more than 25 million biomedical and life sciences references from approximately 5,600 worldwide journals.

TRRUST is a manually curated database of human transcriptional regulatory network with partial information on mode of regulation. It contains 9,396 regulatory interactions of 800 human transcription factors, 5,066 of which are annotated with information on mode of regulation (3,148 repression and 1,918 activation).</p></section><section id="s0025"><h3 id="st025" class="u-h4 u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">3.2.

PubMed engine takes free-text keywords and returns a list of ranked citations that match input keywords. Its search strategy has two major characteristics: first, it adds <a href="/topics/computer-science/boolean-operator" title="Learn more about Boolean operators from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">Boolean operators</a> into user’s query and then uses automatic term mapping (ATM) </span><a name="bb0200" href="#b0200" class="workspace-trigger">[40]</a>.</p><figure class="figure text-xs" id="f0005"><span><img src="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1532046419302746-gr1.jpg" height="354" alt="" aria-describedby="cn005"><ol class="links-for-figure"><li><a class="anchor download-link u-font-sans" href="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1532046419302746-gr1_lrg.jpg" target="_blank" download="" title="Download high-res image (235KB)"><span class="anchor-text">Download : <span class="download-link-title">Download high-res image (235KB)</span></span></a></li><li><a class="anchor download-link u-font-sans" href="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1532046419302746-gr1.jpg" target="_blank" download="" title="Download full-size image"><span class="anchor-text">Download : <span class="download-link-title">Download full-size image</span></span></a></li></ol></span><span class="captions"><span id="cn005"><p id="sp030"><span class="label">Fig. 1</span>. The Information Retrieval workflow. The steps are as follows: first, a Boolean query is built according to the associated entities in the regulatory interaction. It uses our local dictionary integrated from several external databases to complement the query with more synonyms and aliases. Then, the query is submitted to the PubMed engine and abstracts are retrieved for processing. Abstracts with no regulatory events are excluded for further analysis.</p></span></span></figure></div><div><p id="p0075"><span><span>Each query was supplemented with extra terms acquired from several external resources, including HGNC, Entrez, and UniprotKB to fetch more relevant abstracts. We integrated these synonyms into a local dictionary covering gene symbol, synonyms and official full name. A Boolean query was then created to enforce our own search logic to the ATM in order to increase the chance of attaining relevant citations and also to reduce the response time. The query was made with appropriate <a href="/topics/computer-science/boolean-logic" title="Learn more about Boolean logic from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">Boolean logic</a> (AND/OR) on entities and their extra terms using the lookup dictionary. A MeSH descriptor term (e.g. Humans) was also incorporated in the query to further boost the mapping process on PubMed engine. For examples the query for AATF and MYC regulatory interaction is, “humans [msh] AND (AATF[sym] OR BFR2[sym] OR CHE-1[sym] OR CHE1[sym] OR DED[sym] OR </span><a href="/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/programmed-cell-death" title="Learn more about apoptosis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">apoptosis</a> antagonizing transcription factor [GFN]) AND (MYC[sym] OR MRTL[sym] OR MYCC[sym] OR BHLHE39[sym] OR C-MYC[sym] OR MYC proto-oncogene [GFN])”. Note that there is no limit on the number of synonyms (ranging from 0 to 18) used in the query. Accessing our local dictionary is executed rapidly on the client side for this purpose. To estimate the cost of expanding the original query with synonyms and aliases, we compared the turnaround times of both queries on a TRRUST database. </span><a name="bf0010" href="#f0010" class="workspace-trigger">Fig. 2</a> shows the boxplot of turnaround time for both queries.

These subtrees must contain at least one causal event describing the candidate relation between the given pair of genes. Subtrees were extracted by applying a Depth First Search along with a Boolean visited array to avoid possible loops. Nodes with two paths to the entities were considered as a root of the subtree. Next, we utilized a rule based approach to describe relations using three commonly used language constructs <a name="bb0145" href="#b0145" class="workspace-trigger">[29]</a>. The first rule is effector-relation-effectee (e.g. A activates B). The second rule is relation-of-effectee-by-effector (e.g. Activation of A by B). These rules were applied to both paths from root to query entities to identify their regulatory dependency. <a name="bf0025" href="#f0025" class="workspace-trigger">Figs. 5</a><span>b and c illustrate the regulatory relation extraction using these rules. Some sentences in the literature have complex structures, which cannot be captured by these language constructs. To address this, we incorporated a negation rule to increase the performance of the RE system. For example, consider the following sentence: “LMP1 suppresses the transcriptional <a href="/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/repressor-gene" title="Learn more about repressor from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">repressor</a> ATF3, possibly leading to the TGF-induced ID1 upregulation” </span><a name="bb0230" href="#b0230" class="workspace-trigger">[46]</a>. In the first pass the system assigns a positive mode to the interaction between ATF3 and ID1. However, there is a negative interaction between the TF and target gene. The negation rule considers the negative event “suppresses” related to ATF3 and switch the positive mode to negative. <a name="bf0025" href="#f0025" class="workspace-trigger">Fig. 5</a>c shows a subtree reflecting the negation rule.</p><p id="p0110">We then apply the rules to every subtree to extract the mode of regulation between the query genes. The weights of the graph encode repetition of regulatory relations across sentences and abstracts. we considered the weights when there was more than one regulatory event associated with the target gene. In this case, an event with higher weight was selected for ranking the subtree. We also considered distance of events to the target gene when the weights in the subtree were equal. The closest event to the target entity will take the highest priority for determining the interaction mode. Finally, we investigated regulatory mode in every candidate subtree and assigned a total mode of regulation to the interaction using a voting scheme. <a name="bn0005" href="#n0005" class="workspace-trigger">Algorithm 1</a> shows the algorithm used in ModEx to identify mode of regulation.<section><p id="n0005"><strong>Algorithm&nbsp;1</strong></p><p id="p0220">Algorithm for extraction of mode of regulation from evidence sentences. <span class="display"><div class="tables colsep-0 frame-none rowsep-0" id="t0030"><div class="groups"><table><tbody><tr class="valign-top"><td class="align-left"><figure class="inline-figure"><img src="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1532046419302746-fx1.jpg" height="202" alt=""></figure></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></span></p></section></p></section><section id="s0040"><h3 id="st040" class="u-h4 u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">3.5.

As a benchmark, we developed an alternative pipeline using Integrated Network and Dynamical Reasoning Assembler (INDRA), a state-of-the-art text mining pipeline in biomedical domain, <a name="bb0240" href="#b0240" class="workspace-trigger">[48]</a><span>. INDRA is an automated model assembly system interfacing with NLP systems and databases developed for molecular systems biology to collect knowledge and describe molecular mechanisms.

We configured INDRA to only extract, annotate and assemble a rule-based model to identify regulatory information from PubMed. The following steps were taken to assemble the pipeline.

The ability of the algorithm to identify regulators of differential gene expression relies heavily on the quality and the coverage of the regulatory network on which the queries are performed. If the network adequately encapsulates the interaction between TF and genes, the expectation is that the quaternaryProd algorithm should be able to recover the true cause of the modulated expression profile. To test the utility of our network, we used this algorithm along with differential expression profiles from controlled over-expression experiments used in the original study. The over-expression experiments consist of differential gene expression profile from a controlled in vitro E2F3 over expression <a name="bb0270" href="#b0270" class="workspace-trigger">[54]</a> and c-Myc <a name="bb0270" href="#b0270" class="workspace-trigger">[54]</a><span>.

We inputted three networks into the algorithm (1) the original TRUSST network, (2) annotated TRUSST network, and (3) annotated TRRUST augmented with annotated ChIP-Atlas. By annotated TRRUST, we refer to the TRRUST network where interaction with no reported mode of regulation were annotated using our system.

For the E2F3 experiment, E2F1 is returned as the top hypothesis regulator by the algorithm incorporating our annotated networks. E2F1 and E2F3 are close family members and have a very similar role as transcription factors that function to control the cell cycle and are similarly implicated in cancer <a name="bb0275" href="#b0275" class="workspace-trigger">[55]</a>. It is interesting to note that original TRRUST database does not include enough information for algorithm to recover E2F1, however the signal strengthens when TRUSST is annotated with our system and a much more significant p-value is obtained when TRRUST is augmented with annotated ChIP-Atlas.

Conclusion</h2><p id="p0165">In this work we presented a fully automated text-mining system to extract and annotate causal regulatory interaction between transcription factors and genes from the biomedical literature. As a starting point, our method uses putative TF-gene interactions derived from high-throughput ChIP-seq or other experiments and seeks to collect evidence and meta-data in the biomedical literature to support the interaction. It should be noted that annotating a priori known interactions differs significantly in scope and complexity from general text-mining approaches for biomedical relation extraction. The later attempts to extract the <a href="/topics/computer-science/causal-relation" title="Learn more about causal relation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">causal relation</a><span> from biomedical text directly, without prior knowledge of the entities and the interaction, whereas in our method the relation is know from biological experiments and curated databases a priori, thereby reducing the complexity significantly. This approach bridges the gap between data-driven methods and text-mining methods for constructing causal transcriptional <a href="/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/gene-regulatory-network" title="Learn more about gene regulatory networks from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">gene regulatory networks</a> and overcomes some of the drawbacks of either approach. With the rapid increase in high-throughput experiments and biomedical literature, hybrid method such as the one proposed can make a significant impact in biological knowledge retrieval.</span></p><p id="p0170">We used a gold-standard manually curated dataset and demonstrated that our approach can reliably identify the relevant literature and extract the correct interaction and meta-data. We applied our method to high-throughput ChIP-seq data and provided literature support for 1,500 interactions. Our annotated ChIP-derived transcriptional regulatory interaction can be used in conjunction with directional enrichment methods that aim to identify regulators of differential gene expression. Moreover, we use our system to annotate the interactions in the TRRUST database for which more of regulation is not reported. Our system can also be used as a tool to mine the literature for investigate interactions in newly performed ChIP-seq experiments, where researchers are interested to investigate a specific interaction between a protein and a gene. To facilitate usage, we implemented an HTTP REST server for users to programmatically annotate gene regulatory networks using ModEx available via: https://watson.math.umb.edu/modex/[type_query] (See Section <a name="bs0040" href="#s0040" class="workspace-trigger">3.5</a>).
