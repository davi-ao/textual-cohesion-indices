Introduction</h2><p id="par0025">The study of complex networks has been increasingly used in linguistic research to describe the syntactic structure of languages (e.g. <a name="bbib0075" href="#bib0075" class="workspace-trigger">Cavalli-Sforza et al., 1988</a>, <a name="bbib0220" href="#bib0220" class="workspace-trigger">Solé et al., 2010</a>). In this approach, words are described as vertices in a graph, and their association in speech or writing is represented by an edge (<a name="bbib0215" href="#bib0215" class="workspace-trigger">Solé, 2005</a>, <a name="bbib0225" href="#bib0225" class="workspace-trigger">Steyvers and Tenenbaum, 2005</a>). Their topology is a function of the connectivity among its edges, leading to a variety of patterns, including random, small-world, and scale-free networks (<a name="bbib0240" href="#bib0240" class="workspace-trigger">Watts and Strogatz, 1998</a>). In particular, word networks are often described as scale-free, with considerable variation in connectivity between their edges (<a name="bbib0110" href="#bib0110" class="workspace-trigger">Ferrer i Cancho and Solé, 2001</a>, <a name="bbib0010" href="#bib0010" class="workspace-trigger">Albert and Barabási, 2002</a>) such that most words are poorly connected and a few words account for a disproportionately large number of connections (<a name="bbib0215" href="#bib0215" class="workspace-trigger">Solé, 2005</a>). Moreover, scale-free word association networks seem to emerge at a fairly discrete stage during child development from more elementary random networks characteristic of toddler speech (<a name="bbib0080" href="#bib0080" class="workspace-trigger">Corominas-Murtra et al., 2009</a>, but see <a name="bbib0165" href="#bib0165" class="workspace-trigger">Lipkind et al., 2013</a>).</p><p id="par0030">The structure of human syntactic networks is invariably complex, even in fairly simple societies (<a name="bbib0075" href="#bib0075" class="workspace-trigger">Cavalli-Sforza et al., 1988</a>, <a name="bbib0215" href="#bib0215" class="workspace-trigger">Solé, 2005</a>, <a name="bbib0220" href="#bib0220" class="workspace-trigger">Solé et al., 2010</a>). As a consequence, it is difficult to envision the early stages of language evolution. An alternative approach to this issue would be to investigate communication systems of animals with more rudimentary syntactic networks. The physiological similarities in speech acquisition in humans and song development in oscine birds could suggest that avian song syllables networks might represent a valuable model system to investigate syntactic evolution in non-human animals (<a name="bbib0100" href="#bib0100" class="workspace-trigger">Doupe and Kuhl, 1999</a>, <a name="bbib0030" href="#bib0030" class="workspace-trigger">Bolhuis et al., 2010</a>). In addition to the ability to learn songs, vocalizations in oscine birds are complex and flexible, even allowing for the existence of local dialects (<a name="bbib0190" href="#bib0190" class="workspace-trigger">Podos and Warren, 2007</a>, <a name="bbib0070" href="#bib0070" class="workspace-trigger">Catchpole and Slater, 2008</a>), and for the adjustment of their syntax depending on the social context (<a name="bbib0180" href="#bib0180" class="workspace-trigger">Peters et al., 1980</a>, <a name="bbib0205" href="#bib0205" class="workspace-trigger">Searcy et al., 1981</a>, <a name="bbib0150" href="#bib0150" class="workspace-trigger">Kreutzer and Brémond, 1986</a>, <a name="bbib0020" href="#bib0020" class="workspace-trigger">Balaban, 1988</a>, <a name="bbib0135" href="#bib0135" class="workspace-trigger">Holland et al., 2000</a>, <a name="bbib0005" href="#bib0005" class="workspace-trigger">Abe and Watanabe, 2011</a>). For instance, there is variation in phrase arrangement between different populations of <em>Alauda arvensis</em> (<a name="bbib0050" href="#bib0050" class="workspace-trigger">Briefer et al., 2008</a>), leading to a decrease in syllable sharing with geographical distance (<a name="bbib0055" href="#bib0055" class="workspace-trigger">Briefer et al., 2010</a>). Despite the clear parallels between word associations in human language and syllable associations in bird songs, only two studies to date used network metrics to analyze the birdsong syntax (<a name="bbib0055" href="#bib0055" class="workspace-trigger">Briefer et al., 2010</a>, <a name="bbib0200" href="#bib0200" class="workspace-trigger">Sasahara et al., 2012</a>).</p><p id="par0035"><em>Troglodytes musculus</em><span> is a sedentary neotropical oscine with a wide <a href="/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/geographical-distribution" title="Learn more about geographical distribution from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">geographical distribution</a> from southwestern Mexico to the Tierra del Fuego, living in open and semi-open habitats, forest clearings, and areas affected by human disturbance (</span><a name="bbib0210" href="#bib0210" class="workspace-trigger">Sick, 1997</a>).

Their syllable repertoire (number of different syllable types sung by this species) is vast and complex (<a name="bbib0210" href="#bib0210" class="workspace-trigger">Sick, 1997</a>), and preliminary analyses indicated considerable variation in syllable succession, even in a single phrase, suggesting that this species is an ideal model to investigate the syntactic structure of syllable networks.

The recording and characterization of each syllable was made by the same researcher (V.D.). Although this type of classification can introduce subjectivity in our analysis, previous studies show that results using this method do not differ significantly of more advanced mathematical methods (<a name="bbib0170" href="#bib0170" class="workspace-trigger">Nowicki and Nelson, 1990</a>, <a name="bbib0185" href="#bib0185" class="workspace-trigger">Podos et al., 1992</a>, <a name="bbib0035" href="#bib0035" class="workspace-trigger">Botero et al., 2008</a>).

A value <em>a</em><sub><em>ij</em></sub> that is equal or greater than 1 indicates the presence of a link between two nodes, and a value equal to 0 indicates its absence. Edges can be directed if the network implies an order among the nodes, or undirected if it represents only an association between the elements. The network <em>MSeq</em><sub>42&nbsp;×&nbsp;42</sub> was built as a square matrix in which edges are weighted by the total frequency of links between two successive pair of syllable types, and directed according to their respective sequence. The preceding syllables were shown as columns and the subsequent syllables represented as rows. In the second network, named <em>MQuant</em><sub>207&nbsp;×&nbsp;42</sub>, each line represents a different song and each column corresponds to a syllable type. The edges were weighted according to the frequency of syllable use in each song.</p><p id="par0055">We characterized the structure of <em>MSeq</em> according to four commonly used network metrics (<a name="bbib0225" href="#bib0225" class="workspace-trigger">Steyvers and Tenenbaum, 2005</a>): average distance (<em>L</em>), diameter (<em>D</em>), clustering coefficient (<em>C</em>), and the degree distribution <em>P</em>(<em>k</em>)<em>. L</em> and <em>D</em> are closely related metrics and are related to the concept of network path or geodesic distance (<a name="bbib0040" href="#bib0040" class="workspace-trigger">Bouttier et al., 2003</a>). A path in a network is defined by the number of steps necessary to connect two distinct nodes. For example, a linear graph with four sequentially connected nodes requires three steps to reach the farthest nodes. <em>L</em> refers to the average of the shortest path lengths between all pairs of nodes in a network, while <em>D</em> refers to the maximum of these distances over all pairs of nodes in the graph. <em>C</em> is a measure of the proportion of neighboring nodes that can be reached through the nodes of other neighbors, calculated as the proportion of a focal node's neighbors who are themselves neighbors (<a name="bbib0195" href="#bib0195" class="workspace-trigger">Proulx et al., 2005</a>). The clustering coefficient of a network is calculated by the arithmetical mean of the individual <em>C</em><sub>i</sub> for all vertices. Finally, <em>P</em>(<em>k</em>) represents the probability that a randomly chosen node will have degree – the number of nodes that connect the focal node to other nodes – <em>k</em> (i.e., will have <em>k</em> neighbors) (see <a name="bbib0225" href="#bib0225" class="workspace-trigger">Steyvers and Tenenbaum, 2005</a>, <a name="bbib0195" href="#bib0195" class="workspace-trigger">Proulx et al., 2005</a>).</p><p id="par0060">To test if the structure of the networks departed from a random topology, we assessed the extent to which <em>L</em>, <em>D</em>, and <em>C</em> were significantly different from the expected values of equivalent random networks. We compared the observed metrics with the mean value of 1000 simulated datasets using the packages <span class="small-caps">igraph</span>(<a name="bbib0085" href="#bib0085" class="workspace-trigger">Csardi and Nepusz, 2006</a>) and <span class="small-caps">sna</span> (<a name="bbib0060" href="#bib0060" class="workspace-trigger">Butts, 2010</a>) in R software. Random networks were generated according to the Erdös-Rényi model (<a name="bbib0105" href="#bib0105" class="workspace-trigger">Erdös and Rényi, 1959</a>). Parameters were set equal to the number of vertices and edges of the original networks. The model creates an initial graph with N nodes and zero edges. At every step, a new edge is randomly assigned between two nodes. The process is repeated until it is reached a maximum number of edges M. The null expectations for <em>L</em>, <em>D</em>, and <em>C</em> were obtained using the resulting 95% confidence intervals. We calculated the index of small-world-ness (<em>S</em><sup>ws</sup>), according to <a name="bbib0140" href="#bib0140" class="workspace-trigger">Humphries and Gurney (2008)</a>. A network is considered to be small-world if <em>S</em><sup>ws</sup>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;1. <em>P</em>(<em>k</em>) was plotted and compared against the degree distributions of all null models plotted simultaneously. This approach enables us to visualize whether the degree distribution overlaps a most probable range of expected distributions generated stochastically. We also assessed the fit of the degree distribution of this network by comparing it with three alternative models (exponential, power-law, and truncated power law) using the Akaike Information Criterion-AIC (<a name="bbib0015" href="#bib0015" class="workspace-trigger">Amaral et al., 2000</a>). In order to examine the sequential structure of the song, we used a correlation analysis of the number of interactions of each syllable with other syllables, as well as with itself. We also used the frequency of syllable use across the <em>MQuant</em> to test for the existence of Zipf's law – a power-law distribution of syllable use – by comparing it to two alternative models (exponential and truncated power-law) using the Akaike Information Criterion-AIC (<a name="bbib0015" href="#bib0015" class="workspace-trigger">Amaral et al., 2000</a>). According to Zipf's law, if elements are ranked according to their probability of occurrence, from commonest to the rarest, there must be an inverse monotonic relationship between rank of use and probability of occurrence (<a name="bbib0055" href="#bib0055" class="workspace-trigger">Briefer et al., 2010</a>).</p><p id="par0065">Given that both <em>MQuant</em> and <em>MSeq</em> are quantitative matrices, we used the WINE method implemented in the <span class="small-caps">bipartite</span> R package (<a name="bbib0090" href="#bib0090" class="workspace-trigger">Dormann et al., 2008</a>, <a name="bbib0095" href="#bib0095" class="workspace-trigger">Dormann et al., 2009</a><span>).

The <a href="/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/nestedness" title="Learn more about nestedness from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">nestedness</a> index is calculated through the average distance from each matrix cell containing a link to the cell with the lowest marginal totals, in the packed matrix, using a weighted Manhattan distance.

Discussion</h2><p id="par0085">Our study involved a relatively broad sample of notes and, although we concede that it is far from a complete description of the repertoire of the species, our coverage was sufficient to include a large sample of syllables and their associations. For instance, a study analyzing a comprehensive sample of the syllable repertoire of <span><em><a href="/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/troglodytes-aedon" title="Learn more about Troglodytes aedon from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">Troglodytes aedon</a></em></span> (3574 songs of a single individual) showed that the repertoire in that species includes between 37 and 90 syllable types (<a name="bbib0155" href="#bib0155" class="workspace-trigger">Kroodsma, 1973</a>). <a name="bbib0230" href="#bib0230" class="workspace-trigger">Tubaro (1990)</a> characterized the repertoire of <em>T. aedon</em> in two populations in Argentina and also demonstrated similar values for repertoire size (38 different syllable types) and number of song types as those found in our study for <em>T. musculus.</em> Therefore, we believe that our sampling (from 170 individuals and 207 songs) is a representative estimate of the syllable repertoire of the species, at least at the geographical scale involved in our study.</p><p id="par0090">The pattern of syllable associations’ in <em>T. musculus</em> songs can be classified as a small-world network, given that the average distance was lower and the clustering coefficient was higher than expected by chance (<a name="bbib0240" href="#bib0240" class="workspace-trigger">Watts and Strogatz, 1998</a>). Interestingly, similar patterns were observed in word association networks of several languages (<a name="bbib0225" href="#bib0225" class="workspace-trigger">Steyvers and Tenenbaum, 2005</a>, <a name="bbib0220" href="#bib0220" class="workspace-trigger">Solé et al., 2010</a>). Moreover, there are qualitative similarities in the degree distribution among syllables and words association networks, such as the large number of syllables with a low observed number of associations, whereas other syllables are used more than expected by chance (<a name="bfig0025" href="#fig0025" class="workspace-trigger">Fig. 5</a>). On the other hand, the syllable degree distribution was best fit by a truncated power law, whereas word association networks are more commonly described by scale-free distributions. These networks also differ with respect to the slope of the degree distribution. <a name="bbib0115" href="#bib0115" class="workspace-trigger">Ferrer i Cancho et al. (2004)</a> investigated several word association networks and found a slope of 2.2, whereas the slopes of the networks in the present study are considerably lower (<a name="btbl0010" href="#tbl0010" class="workspace-trigger">Table 2</a>: in-degree&nbsp;=&nbsp;−0.20 and out-degree&nbsp;=&nbsp;−0.16). It is possible that these discrepancies occur because syllable association networks are considerably smaller than word association networks, as well as the fact that avian songs must always maintain the goal of species recognition (see below). Nevertheless, the concordance in <em>C</em>, <em>L</em> and the general shape of the degree distributions might be interpreted as indicating common underlying mechanisms that could be universal for communication networks.</p><p id="par0095"><a name="bbib0055" href="#bib0055" class="workspace-trigger">Briefer et al. (2010)</a> showed that the frequency distribution of note use in the Eurasian Skylark <em>A. arvensis</em> deviates from a simple power law distribution expected from Zipf's law, following instead a curve reaching asymptotically a slope of zero. They interpreted this pattern as an indication that the syllable repertoire in this species can be a closed system due to the learning strategy based on imitation of young birds from their tutors, without the role of the improvisation. However, we interpret our results in the case of <em>T. musculus</em> in a slightly different manner. Rather, we believe that best fit of the distribution of degrees by a truncated power law function could have three implications: (i) a power law model could indicate that improvisation might be important in the song syntax, and that syllable composition in <em>T. musculus</em> is open to novel syllables (<a name="bbib0065" href="#bib0065" class="workspace-trigger">Catchpole, 1976</a>); (ii) the final truncation suggests a possible constraint to the level of improvisation; and (iii) the introduction of new syllables might occur through errors during the process of copying the tutor by young males. A test of the latter hypothesis would require an experiment tutoring birds of different ages to investigateif new notes (or rare notes) are product of improvisation or errors during the learning process.</p><p id="par0100"><span>We found substantial levels of <a href="/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/nestedness" title="Learn more about nestedness from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">nestedness</a> in both </span><em>MQuant</em> and <em>MSeq</em>. Nestedness is a pervasive feature of several real-world networks (e.g. <a name="bbib0025" href="#bib0025" class="workspace-trigger">Bascompte et al., 2003</a>, <a name="bbib0130" href="#bib0130" class="workspace-trigger">Guimarães et al., 2006</a>, <a name="bbib0235" href="#bib0235" class="workspace-trigger">Ulrich et al., 2009</a>). In a context of birdsong structure, a nested pattern implies that syllables that are highly connected tend to be associated with both highly-connected and less-connected syllables. On the other hand, syllables that connect with few others are most frequently associated with these highly connected ones. As a result, this network presents a topology in which low-connected syllables preferentially interact around a core of highly connected syllables. As for <em>MQuant</em>, the nested topology indicates that the most frequent syllables are associated with songs of both high and low number of syllable types, and songs with small number of syllable types tend to contain syllables from this core of most frequent ones. These patterns offer new insights in the study of bird song syntax because they allow for not only on the description of the frequency or the number of associations of each syllable, but also allow us to understand the characteristics of the nodes with which they are connected.</p><p id="par0105">We believe that two mechanisms could be responsible for the nested organization of these networks. First, the simplest explanation is that a nested topology could be an epiphenomenon of the fact that syllables differ considerably in their frequency of use. As a consequence, rare syllables would simply tend to be associated by chance alone. Alternatively, there could be a syntactic value in a nested topology if more frequently used syllables are important for species recognition, whereas rare ones would be more important for female preference. If that is the case, there should be a trade-off between recognition and preference, with common syllables forming association cores and being interspersed with improvisation using rare syllables. This is also supported by the observation that shorter songs always maintain the most commonly used syllables. Although these are not mutually exclusive mechanisms, specific studies focusing on the pattern of syllables succession within single males could be particularly useful to assess their relative contribution.</p><p id="par0110">The similarities between the topological properties of the syllable association networks recorded in our study for the house wren, as well as the results of other studies on avian communication, suggests the possibility of general principles underlying avian syllable&nbsp;association networks. For instance, the song network in the California Trasher (<span><em><a href="/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/toxostoma" title="Learn more about Toxostoma from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">Toxostoma</a></em><em> redivivum</em></span>) also followed a small-world pattern and a non bell-shaped degree distribution <em>P</em>(<em>k</em>), despite large individual differences in the sizes of their phrase repertoires and their specific phrase types (<a name="bbib0200" href="#bib0200" class="workspace-trigger">Sasahara et al., 2012</a><span>). Despite using simpler methods that do not involve explicitly reconstructing the topology of syllable association networks, previous studies investigating syntax in oscine birds had already found evidence for predictability in song organization. For instance, both in <a href="/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/cyperaceae" title="Learn more about sedge from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">sedge</a> warbler </span><span><em><a href="/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/acrocephalus" title="Learn more about Acrocephalus from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">Acrocephalus</a></em><em> schoenobaenus</em></span> (<a name="bbib0065" href="#bib0065" class="workspace-trigger">Catchpole, 1976</a>) and in the willow warbler <span><em><a href="/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/phylloscopus" title="Learn more about Phylloscopus from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">Phylloscopus</a></em><em> trochilus</em></span> (<a name="bbib0125" href="#bib0125" class="workspace-trigger">Gill and Slater, 2000</a>), syllable organization is clearly nonrandom, such that their probabilities of occurrence depends at least on the immediately preceding syllable. Moreover, most willow warbler songs start with the same element and there after elements are produced in a highly predictable way.</p><p id="par0115">The network analysis of syllables associations is still a poorly explored view into the study of song evolution. In the present study we demonstrate that this approach can provide several interesting insights in relation to traditional methods, allowing for a more precise description of songs with complex syntax, especially in the case of oscine birds. Moreover, it would be of particular interest to establish the extent of the parallels between syllables and word association networks, such as the relationship between syllable use and their rate of evolutionary change (<a name="bbib0175" href="#bib0175" class="workspace-trigger">Pagel et al., 2007</a>).</p></section></div><section id="ack0005"><h2 id="sect0050" class="u-h3 u-margin-l-top u-margin-xs-bottom">Acknowledgments</h2><p id="par0120">We thank the <span id="gs0005">Instituto Internacional de Educação do Brasil (IEB)</span> for funding fieldwork.
