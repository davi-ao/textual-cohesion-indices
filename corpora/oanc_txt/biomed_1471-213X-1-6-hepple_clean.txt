bowfin amium calva garpike lepisosteus osseus be frequently compare other anatomical character be basal actinopterygian. study development be appropriate sequel previous work member chondrosteus. paddlefish polyodon [ 12 ] sturgeon. huso acipenser [ 13 ]. garpike have three developmental character immediately separate bowfin. show meroblastic cleavage possess well-defined yolk syncytial layer event gastrulation produce pit associate dorsal blastoderm margin. pit be formation maneuver temporary structure result cell migration. have apparent ultimate morphogenetic significance eventually

one two garpike cleavage furrow even extend vegetal pole be nothing more shallow groove yolk cell cortex. eventually regress. garpike therefore have single yolk cell similar teleost. condition set stage later appearance yolk syncytial layer ysl otherwise uniquely teleostean feature. phylogenetic point view garpike ysl mark first evolutionary appearance actinopterygian fish. teleost ysl have important mechanical communication function early development [ 19 20 21 ]. therefore presence lepisosteus raise interesting question role there. one long be pursue. ray-finned fish bichir sturgeon paddlefish display dorsal lip surface cell migrate interior [ 12 13 16 17 ]. other [ 22 23 ] report similar condition bowfin circumstance later show be mistake [ 14 15 ]. teleost fish lack blastopore
