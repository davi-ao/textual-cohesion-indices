kofus annan secretary- general united nation recently call attention clear inequality science develop develop country challenge building bridge gap bring united nation world scientific community closer other annan 2003. mr annan stress importance reduce inequality science develop develop country assert unbalanced distribution scientific activity generate serious problem not only scientific community develop country development. indeed mr annan sentiment have also be echo recently several scientist present overwhelming evidence disparity scientific output develop already develop country gibb 1995. may 1997. goldemberg 1998. riddoch 2000. example recent united nation educational scientific cultural organization unesco estimate unesco 2001 indicate 1997 develop country account 84 % global investment scientific research development have approximately 72 % world researcher produce approximately 88 % scientific technical publication register science citation index scus. north america europe clearly dominate number scientific publication produce annually 36 6 % 37 % respectively worldwide unesco 2001. north america europe clearly dominate number scientific publication produce annually. be rather obvious richer country be able invest more resource science therefore account largest number publication. be also likely be statistical bias part scus bibliometric database represent north american european publication far better rest world gibb 1995. may 1997. alonso fernández- juricic 2001. vohora vohora 2001. be disparity scientific contribution develop develop world actually remain unchanged even increase mr annan have imply. closer look trend last decade reveal important advance develop country. example latin america china represent respectively only 1 8 % 2 % scientific publication worldwide have increase number publication 1990 1997 36 % 70 % respectively be much higher percentage increment reach europe 10 % industrial asium 26 %. percentage global scientific publication north america actually decrease 8 % same period unesco 2001. use scus database produce institute scientific information isus as well datum compile red iberoamericana indicadore ciencium y tecnología ricyt examine difference number proportion scientific publication develop world develop world 1990 2000 focus america case study. not surprisingly be huge disparity number publication 1990 2000 united state contribute lion share 84 % follow canada 10 35 %. latin america whole contribute only 5 45 % total number scientific publication ten year ricyt 2002. total number publication however be not necessarily best measure assess scientific productivity technical advance may 1997. more relevant measurement factor include proportional change number publication total number publication correct investment research development may 1997. proportional change number publication use 1990 comparison reveal scientific publishing latin america increase most rapidly america far outpace united state canada figure. further analysis correct number overall publication amount money invest research development region also show contrast canada united state trend latin america have be increase relative output 1990 s figure. moreover take account amount research money available researcher latin america actually out-published united state canada year 2000 figure. cost research be undoubtedly cheaper develop world due relatively low researcher salary overhead other work standard factor do not explain substantial increase number publication amount money allocate research development latin america particularly 1995 2000 figure. other relative indicator scientific productivity such number publication pick up scus relation number scientist particular country also demonstrate such developing region latin america be make substantial contribution science fact average proportion gross domestic product gdp invest science latin america 10. year period be only 21 % amount invest united state ricyt 2002. indeed scientific productivity be remarkable compare relatively low investment science compare gdp latin america whole. fact albornoz 2001 conclude group latin america afford invest much higher proportion resource scientific research development. latin american investment research development represent only 0 59 % regional gdp 1998 very weak effort compare united state 2 84 % canada 1 %. latin american country be high degree variability publication rate as well financial investment science technology. country have perform particularly well. example uruguay chile panama cuba average respectively 6 8 5 3 5 2 3 4 publication million dollar research development investment 10 year study be notoriously high compare united state 1 even canada 3 ricyt 2002. other country such costa rica cuba brazil chile have invest much greater proportion gdp research development other country region albornoz 2001. have number publication dollar invest research development be increase latin america decrease united state canada. one potential explanation increase scientific productivity latin america be scientific development 1990 s be particularly strong many country region. indeed explain rapid rise number publication latin america compare relatively flat increase united state canada be publish just as well beginning decade. potentially more important question however be number publication dollar invest research development have be increase latin america decrease united state canada. pattern be result variety factor none be mutually exclusive. be possible publishing international journal measure scientific productivity be become more important latin america. increase funding most productive scientist national science development program have be important stimulus. international cooperation result more scientific collaboration scientist latin america europe united state also have increase relative number publication latin america. contrast decrease trend number publication investment dollar canada united state reflect trend more costly research larger scientific program. exactly be relative impact such developing region latin america scientific community. use scus 2001 datum examine proportion publication area ecology include field evolutionary biology conservation biology global change biology 1990 2002 two top general science journal nature science. impact factor 27 96 23 33 respectively 20 top ecological journal impact factor 10 51 – 2 47 isus 2001. credit region publication author be affiliate institution region. thus more one region receive credit single publication publication have be write multiple author institution different region. top 20 ecological journal american subcontinent south central north america account 62 % publication worldwide. america however latin america represent only 6 % canada united state account respectively 13 % 82 % top 20 ecological publication. examine datum contribution top 10 ecological journal impact factor 10 51 – 3 31 top 11 – 20 impact factor 3 28 – 2 47 latin american country contribute nearly twice many publication journal second category 8 % top 11 – 20 compare 4 % top 10. finding suggest publication such developing region latin america be fall short reach top journal. contrast united state contribute somewhat more publication top 10 journal 84 % top 11 – 20 journal 79 %. difference proportion publication contribute united state top 10 top 20 journal be even more pronounced examine respect worldwide publication. case united state contribute 60 % publication top 10 journal only 40 % publication top 11 – 20 journal. interestingly proportion publication latin america united state canada subject area science nature be nearly identical top 20 ecological journal. science nature latin america have 7 % publication america 6 % top 20 ecological journal united state canada have 81 % 82 % 12 % 13 % respectively. similarity suggest latin american researcher be not shy away two top-ranked general science journal. however publishing science nature be not enough gain prominence evidence number citation researcher. latest list 247 most-cited researcher ecology environmental science emphasize overwhelming contribution author north america 73 % europe 21 % isus 2001. researcher work latin american institution be include remain 6 %. overall datum indicate scientific output field ecology latin america be have relatively low impact international scientific community be underrepresented top international journal robust productivity measure number publication researcher funding amount. similar finding be also report asium swinbank al 1997 thus be general phenomenon develop world. be outstanding scientific researcher develop world independently be make important contribution international scientific community be exception. general do latin american scientist often fail reach top journal become most cite researcher field. one possibility be main research agenda region be somewhat different top journal be publish develop world respond more scientific mainstream develop region. be not suggest sort conspiracy rather imply perception most important science be link region major funding agency as well most prominent journal share similar economic region also share same perception science be most interesting. consideration be more local journal develop region be list scus similar journal develop region gibb 1995. consequently be more high-profile regional publication opportunity available scientist develop region much research publish locally develop world be overlook. take more publish good papers become highly cite scientist. require attend international meeting introduce novel research finding multiple scientific forum. funding activity however require greater proportion research money be spend meeting researcher develop compare develop world. positive trend scientific productivity latin america not be misinterpret reason be unconcerned exist gap highlight mr annan. be many compelling reason push increase scientific input develop world goldemberg 1998. annan 2003. one be science discipline benefit contribution many disparate group world rather be dominate two geographic region. many scientific problem be solve much more readily cooperation scientific insight scientist develop region. climate change biodiversity research example urgently need scientific input develop region be so important global process. be also critical develop world promote research publication area concern be have proportionally greater scientific social impact. be now example research priority area develop nation actually become pioneering work area neglect research agenda industrialize world. have be case research renewable energy source brazil goldemberg 1998 biomedical science cuba castro díaz- balart 2002. example be important not only region develop world be also scientific innovation greatly advance knowledge rest world. climate change biodiversity research urgently need scientific input develop region be so important global process. evidence present here demonstrate be long way go develop country contribute more equitable share international scientific community be also reason be optimistic. relative increase number publication especially correct amount money available research development demonstrate many developing country be head right direction. extremely high scientific productivity many developing nation correct rather limited availability fund suggest increase funding science be excellent investment develop nation term publication measure scientific output particularly publication target journal have greatest impact. still be long road travel feel optimistic bridge mention mr annan be slowly be build
