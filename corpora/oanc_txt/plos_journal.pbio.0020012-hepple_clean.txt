kenyon. then especially past few year response later finding graduate student have be scramble chance work laboratory. n't believe difference—there be such resistance say. daf- 2 make huge difference. then so do subsequent research field. most significant finding be identification many more longevity gene. result publish july derive directly early work daf- 2. discover order long-lived worm live so

insulin / igf- 1 pathway age have have profound impact own lifestyle include tendency discard bread sandwich eat only topping pizza box. be low-carb diet. give worm glucose shorten lifespan. [ diet ] make sense keep insulin level down say. caloric restriction extend lifespan mouse so do insulin / igf- 1 pathway note. indeed start low-calorie diet point adulthood appear help fruit fly live longer accord research britain publish last september. do n't know sure mouse kenyon continue be two pathway be different same. much age research focus two influence say be two area investigation. laboratory report december 2002 inhibit respiration mitochondrium develop worm increase longevity have effect adult worm reason still unexplained say. further microarray analysis be underway pinpoint cause simply lie downstream insulin / igf- 1 pathway be something different altogether. then be research look effect lifespan change organism reproductive system. kenyon such work often involve battle convince sceptic longevity be not trade-off fertility. four year ago laboratory report kill germ cell increase lifespan worm 60 % only because stress affect endocrine signall not prevent reproduction. further research publish last year show quite clearly say age reproduction be controll independently one. recent work infertile worm live six time as long normal following removal entire reproductive system say. intervene hormone signall pathway directly think animal still live six time as long normal be fertile well. jim carey be one trade-off sceptic. be population biologist university californium davi research effect life expectancy replace ovary old mouse ovary younger mouse be intend complement kenyon work. insist honest discussion lifespan extension include consideration tradeoff. many manipulation extend lifespan model system genetic dietary example ignore gloss side effect such permanent sterility huge weight loss distorted organ-to-body ratio major behavioural aberration note. be inconceivable life-extending therapy ever be develop be able extend life independent other change conclude. life system be interlinked hierarchically integrate level so talk life extension use analogy car warranty concept be wrong-headed. trade-off sceptic take different tack. armand lerous put. occasional period involuntary celibacy have think well not be get lay least live miserable solitary old age. lerous evolutionary biologist imperial college science technology medicine london offer optimistic appraisal chance find cure age new book effect genetic variety human body. see age simply collection curable disease. be obvious impediment advance nothing make think human being have fix lifespan
