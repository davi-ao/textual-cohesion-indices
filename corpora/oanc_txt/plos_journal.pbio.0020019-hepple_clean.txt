individual wild population show remarkably little morphological variation give amount environmental variation encounter development amount genetic variation population. phenotypic constancy lead proposal individual be somehow buffered canalized genetic environmental variation waddington 1942. clearly such mechanism have important evolutionary consequence. natural selection act phenotypic

individual potentially undergo large rapid phenotypic change. experiment drosophilum arabidopsis have suggest hsp 90 heat shock protein 90 member family protein express high temperature heat shock be excellent candidate bring canalization rutherford lindquist 1998. queitsch al 2002. several feature hsp 90 suggest be evolutionary buffer capable hide then release genetic variation. individual

bergman siegal 2003 use numerical simulation complex network ten gene gene be capable influence expression other gene as well figure 1. network essentially define genotype individual population amount gene expression equilibrium define phenotype. comparison population found wild-type individual single gene knockout reveal much higher level phenotypic variation population derive knockout. thus population derive knockout express phenotypic variation be not express wild-type network suggest gene network buffer genetic variation. suggest least one aspect generating evolutionary buffer be not

three ten network gene change vice versa ie be shift environmental condition favour different phenotype. population evolve mutation process reach new optimum population mutation process. thus knockout mutation be clearly beneficial speed adaptation new phenotypic optimum release hide genetic variation thereby provide new substrate natural selection act. yet mutation be not couple new environment suggest release hide genetic variation do not have be link environmental change order be beneficial. simulation describe bergman siegal 2003 suggest key property evolutionary buffer ability store then release genetic variation response environmental genetic change be not unique hsp 90. indeed simulation suggest evolutionary buffer be widespread property gene network. also suggest hide genetic
