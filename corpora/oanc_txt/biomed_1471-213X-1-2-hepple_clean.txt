cell migration be one most important complex cellular behavior. be essential animal development immune system function wind repair. defect cell migration lead human disease such birth defect failure control cell migration be important step tumor metastasis. currently believe migrate cell extend retract actin rich protrusion lamellipodium filopodium environment. protrusion adhere strongly enough be stabilize fail retract. way cell cell process follow adhesive guidance cue. model have be time [ 1 ] be only now begin understand molecular signal cause cell initiate movement cell move signal guide cell migration signal stop cell appropriate position. recently progress understanding cell migration have come study caenorhabditis elegan drosophilum [ 2 ]. most cell migration gene identify simple invertebrate be conserved vertebrate confirm efficacy genetically tractable system study cell migration. c elegan be particularly attractive system study cell migration. animal be transparent anatomically simple so cell migration be follow live animal stage development fluorescence microscopy gfp fusion protein nomarskus microscopy. cell lineage cell migration be invariant animal animal so migration defect be easily identify. several genetic screen perform c elegan have identify mutation interfere cell migration review see [ 2 3 ]. mutation affect cell migration other only affect migration limited subset cell. not surprisingly many mutant also show defect axon extension bundle pathfind. gene identify mutation encode extracellular protein cell surface receptor fibroblast growth factor-like protein receptor adhesion molecule small gtpase non-muscle myosin transcription factor. c elegan three gene unc. 6 unc. 5 unc. 40 guide cell process dorsal-ventral axis [ 4 ]. gene be

unc- 6. unc- 5 promote dorsal migration unc- 40 promote ventral migration response unc- 6 signal. base study other species difference unc- 5 unc- 40 guide cell axon lie intracellular domain [ 5 6 ]. mutation unc- 129 member transform growth factor β tgfβ superfamily be identify genetic suppressor ectopic unc- 6 signal [ 7 ]. unc- 129 be express dorsally loss unc- 129 function disrupt dorsal axon

cell axon anterior-posterior axis c elegan be not as well understand. two gene involve anterior-posterior cell migration be vab- 8 mig- 13. vab- 8 be kinesin-related protein act cell autonomously be involve posterior cell migration [ 9 10 ]. therefore vab- 8 be probably involve cellular response guidance cue. mig- 13 be novel transmembrane protein act non-cell autonomously be involve anterior

touch receptor neuron two flp neuron two pvd neuron. mec- 3 unc- 86 protein form heterodimer bind activate mec- 3 promoter promoter touch receptor-specific gene such mec- 7 mec- 4 [ 13 14 15 ]. way mec- 3 activate own transcription probably prevent dedifferentiation touch neuron. later development mec- 17 also contribute maintenance mec- 3 expression [ 16 ]. show here sequence upstream mec- 3 transform c elegan high copy array alter extent direction alm touch receptor neuron migration. sequence also disrupt extension plm touch receptor axon. defect do not result rna interference rnaus heavy genetic load carry transgenic array expression gfp rol- 6 marker gene use make transgenic array. alm migration defect be due specific dna sequence only occur be many copy sequence array. sequence do not affect cell migration alm / bdu cell division position bdu cell. conclude therefore sequence be sequestering factor help control alm migration plm axon outgrowth. also suggest factor

therefore alm migration plm axonal morphology defect be not due rnaus. determine migration defect result have many copy titrate sequence make transformant different mixture plasmid genomic dna. kelly

average position bdus ea 363 be 3 6 n 50. thus alm / bdu cell division be take place bdus be migrate normally strain. determine alm migration defect be sensitive temperature grow ea 471 tu 2562 15 ° c

extrachromosomal array cause alm touch receptor neuron migrate aberrantly cause plm touch receptor neuron axonal defect. defect be not due rnaus nonspecific effect carry transgenic array expression gfp marker gene use make transformant. rather defect result transgenic array contain many copy specific sequence mec- 3 upstream control region. figure 1 ashow direction extent alm bdu cell migration. alms fail migrate remain position 5 [ 12 ]. strain transform titrate sequence alms often migrated anteriorly rather posteriorly be locate anterior position 5. thus array appear be sequestering factor control direction extent alm migration. presumably bdu neuron normally inherit small amount factor migrate anteriorly alms inherit larger amount factor migrate posteriorly. alms show defect axon

cell be deprive own axon guidance cue have follow bdu axon guidance cue. figure 4 show sequence upstream pst restriction site appear contribute strongly alm migration defect. plasmid contain sequence pjc 8 pjc 3 pjc induce many alm migration defect plasmid lack sequence ppd 118 17 pjc induce few migration defect. figure 6 show upstream mec- 3 sequence alone pjc 10 be sufficient induce migration defect. smaller piece sequence upstream pst site be also sufficient induce alm migration defect figure 7. smallest sequence test cause migration defect pjc 16 figure 7 contain only 157 bp upstream eco rus restriction site. conclusion assume array generate construct have roughly same number copy titrate sequence. controll strain-to-strain variability array size discard strain low transmission frequency see material method combine datum least three independently generate strain transform construct. strain-to-strain variability be small assumption be probably valid. other sequence titrate sequence appear facilitate bind factor factor involve controll alm cell migration. instance plasmid pjc 10 contain more surround sequence be more effective pjc 15. surround sequence contain additional binding site factor migration factor interact other protein bind mec- 3 upstream sequence. thus binding one factor cooperatively facilitate binding other factor. lus al [ 26 ] identify sequence

interesting sequence structure result juxtaposition transcription factor binding site. instance sequence 72. 92 be excellent binding site forward reverse orientation drosophilum stat transcription

element appear be correctly express. aspect then mec- 3 expression be affect control element. mec- 3 be activate unc- 86 protein [ 13 14 15 ]. once mec- 3 protein be make unc- 86 mec- 3 form heterodimer more effectively activate mec- 3. perhap titrate element be involve initial mec- 3 activation. role not be apparent mec- 3 gfp fusion gene be activate endogenous unc- 86 / mec- 3

arise due have many copy titrate sequence. array make few copy pjc 4 do not induce alm migration defect array contain many copy pjc 4 do thus suggest array alter alm cell migration act titrate control factor. be somewhat surprising high copy array titrate factor low enough level induce phenotype. transgenic array c elegan contain 50. 100 copy plasmid use make array [ 29 ]. assume copy titrate sequence bind only one molecule then shift concentration dna binding factor as few 100 molecule cause alm migration defect. factor be titratable be present low concentration bind high affinity mec- 3

migration be affect titrate sequence other phenotype be observe animal severe alm migration defect. incidence plm axonal defect correlated well alm migration defect. believe therefore plm defect be induce titration same factor factor control alm migration. case cell fail correctly interpret anterior-posterior spatial information. however alms migrated more anterior position plm axon often
