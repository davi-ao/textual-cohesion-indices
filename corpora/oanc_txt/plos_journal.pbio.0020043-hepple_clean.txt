chimerism—the presence two genetically distinct cell lineage individual life stage—is find few family scale insect nowhere else nature. avid naturalist want understand sort deep oddity own sake such understanding have broader implication as well. instance human be not usually chimera do have quasi-chimeric phase life cycle. pregnancy. disease pregnancy be apparently due conflict genetically

uniquely stable intimate chimerism armored scale insect. sexual animal plant production egg cell involve meiosis complex cellular process involve dna replication recombination two nuclear division one

polar body degenerate—they never divide again be lose destroyed—and oocyte be single maternal cell fusion single paternal cell spermatocyte develop embryo. armored scale polar body fuse together triploid cell three copy chromosome triploid cell also wind embryo figure. triploid cell derive polar body fuse one cell embryo become pentaploid cell five copy chromosome. pentaploid cell then proliferate form bacteriome embryo brown 1965. cell bacteriome thus contain two copy mother complete genome addition same haploid paternal genome rest embryo. contrast rest embryo contain just one

most tissue very early development—but be never eliminate bacteriome. result most male armored scale insect tissue include sperm have one copy half mother genome same genome oocyte develop bacteriome

chimerism involve activate polar body. essentially have idea largely one have even ventured serious guess. phenomenon be discover early 20 th century theoretical tool make sense be unavailable. one such tool be w d hamilton 1964 theory inclusive fitness hold degree cooperation two organism tissue depend degree genetic relatedness. rise hamiltonian think coincide eclipse classical cytogenetic favor molecular biology model organism remarkable little chimera have languish undeserved obscurity. perhap merely look modern eye turn plausible hypothesis. consider special theoretical difficulty pose chimerism tissue derive oocyte derive polar body eject meiosis. two sibling typically exhibit degree sible rivalry—their interest be not identical. individual be chimera comprise full-sibling tissue identical approximately half genome be conflict two nonidentical cell lineage there be tissue mother mammal fetus also identical half genome pregnancy haig 2002. explain obligate sible chimerism never evolve perhap very limited case blood cell sible marmoset. problem cooperation tissue derive oocyte derive polar body be anything even greater. oocyte polar body be less closely relate two sibling be polar body be enriched chromosome region not present oocyte. be cross homologous chromosome meiosis then first meiotic division consistently separate chromosome derive mother mother chromosome derive mother father produce two cell be not relate other more precisely exactly as closely relate other mother mother be mother father. crossing prevent create mosaic relate unrelated chromosome region product first meiotic division uncertain relationship final four meiotic product. nonetheless consistently depress relatedness oocyte polar body help explain polar body be almost alway eliminated—sibling rivalry be even greater sibling be derive other polar body. so do two family scale insect tame domesticate potentially fractious polar body rather kill like normal animal do. there be least three line think seem promising unravel mystery. be interesting parallel one hand chimerism see armored scale insect other hand eusociality true sociality see ant honeybee. ant honeybee sterile individual worker provide nutrition potentially fertile sibling. armored scale insect genetically distinct ultimately sterile cell lineage bacteriome provide nutrition potentially fertile sible cell lineage rest scale insect — course polar body-derived cell be sible strange special sense. ant bee armored scale insect be effectively haplodiploid. male transmit only chromosome inherit mother male sperm be identical other. clonality sperm boost relatedness sister hamilton 1964 point high relatedness explain high level cooperation sister see eusocial ant honeybee. high level cooperation sister have be find haplodiploid thrips as well crespus 1992. be tempting speculate similar explanation be apply histological eusociality see cooperation relate tissue scale insect. temptation increase consider case old cytogenetic literature apparent histological eusociality not true permanent chimerism. occur few family parasitoid wasp tremblay caltagirone 1973. strand grbic

similar ant honeybee scale insect wasp be haplodiploid. be tempting conclude haplodiploidy play same role promote histological eusociality do promote organismal eusociality temptation probably be resist. case parasitoid wasp polar body-derived tissue have paternal genome clonality sperm cannot boost relatedness anything. case armored scale insect chimerism bacteriome do have copy paternal genome copy be identical paternal genome rest embryo so sense two tissue do have high relatedness similar high relatedness full sibling haplodiploidy. scale insect bacteriome get copy paternal genome directly embryo clonality sperm source elevate relatedness haplodiploid sister apparently have nothing do. other explanation be probably need. note that relationship polar body-derived tissue rest insect polar body contain mother complete genome. polar body be less related average sibling be be more related sibling course mother be. perhap polar body function somehow enforce maternal family interest nip bud sible rivalry otherwise suppress family fitness. haplodiploid group female be more closely relate full sister share three-quarter gene copy brother share only one-quarter gene copy. so be competition sibling resource female be expect behave more antagonistically brother more cooperatively sister. contrast female be equally relate son be daughter carry half gene copy. asymmetry relatedness lead struggle haplodiploid social group mother seek direct more resource son sister seek direct more resource away brother other seger stubblefield 2002. be difficult see such struggle play scale insect be hardly social insect. only motile stage female life be first instar crawler settle one spot permanently. male be slightly more mobile have motile usually winged adult form. nonetheless low motility female fact live mostly long-lived woody plant mean maternal kin interact long timescale social insect. scale insect appear make relatively sophisticated social decision settle settle thus possibly compete more closely non-kin kin kasuya 2000. most scale insect use phloem sap almost inexhaustible resource armored scale use parenchyma tissue rosen 1990 be locally exhaust therefore compete neighbor food. thus be conceivable female compete brother sister resource make decision affect intensity competition such decision have different optimum perspective maternal paternal gene. possibly presence massive contingent maternal gene double dose complete maternal genome nutritionally significant tissue bacteriome somehow affect such decision way favorable maternal interest. proximal mechanism include effect signal perception relate relatedness gender site quality satiety. similar manipulation intersible interaction be go case parasitoid wasp have polar body-derived membrane egg. sometime wasp lie single unfertilized male egg single fertilize female egg same host. egg divide form embryo divide clone many embryo. embryo become sterile precocious larva apparently attack other larva try use same host—including potentially own sibling ode hunter 2002. here be situation polar body gene membrane surround proliferate embryo have very different selective optimum level between-sibling aggressiveness—and even rate development—than gene embryo surround apparently mediate nutrition embryo be able influence embryo develop. endosymbiotic bacteria dwell scale insect bacteriome be maternally inherit. thus perspective bacteria male insect be deadend. many maternally inherit bacteria have evolve manipulate host genetic system own advantage. bacterial lineage induce parthenogenesis feminize male. bacteria even evolve suicidally kill male embryo find death male free resource sister use majerus 2003. order do bacteria respond cue indicate gender
