modification intervention older adult be merely overweight appear be fruitless intervention probably not have direct effect yol yhl. weight weight change be sometime use outcome evaluation intervention such diet exercise program. fact weight be not associate consistent way health suggest such evaluation be consider critically older adult be subject. be particularly important light recent finding find intervention such weight-loss drug be harmful [ 33 34 ]. older adult risk associate higher weight be especially unclear optimal outcome trial weight loss older adult require specific attention improve health mortality. interestingly strongest health relationship be find underweight older adult. clinical trial objective be make underweight as healthy normal-weight peer presumably address underlie condition cause low weight be perform efficiently use yol yhl outcome measure. yol yhl be clinically significant patient group. ch participant be somewhat healthier average older adult. however adjustment detailed covariate make little difference finding. estimate last four year health datum 10 % sample result group be similar. analysis mean yol instead more traditional survival analysis survival analysis be appropriate here virtually person be lose follow-up. bias cause over-adjustment be probably not large finding be not sensitive number variable adjust. result be

yhl be base have miss effect obesity risk factor future health. person be depress poor self-image relate obesity have osteo-arthriti relate obesity limit activity successfully avoid pain surely have
