people receive introduction cancer genetics college first half 1990 s everything look simple straightforward. be stuff explain sincerely interested relative want know be spend time. be oncogene be tumour suppressor gene. oncogene be overactive gene protein somehow cause cancer be overactive. therefore be dominant. tumour suppressor gene be gene normally prevent tumour happen need be inactivated tumour start form. copy tumour suppressor gene have be inactivated mutation be recessive. inactivation gene be random process be understandable people inherit inactivated copy tumour suppressor gene have higher risk develop associate form s cancer people bear two normal copy postulated alfred knudson 1971 two-hit model. indeed be show tumour predisposed patient remain wild-type copy tumour suppressor gene be lose process refer loss heterozygosity. 1998 thing start change. venkatachalam al 1998 publish paper embo journal describe detail study tumour mouse lack one copy p 53 tumour suppressor gene trp 53. gene be know be most mutate gene human cancer function be central many process be involve cellular prevention cancer. mouse lack copy gene be most part viable succumb cancer mainly thymic lymphoma three five month age donehower al 1992. mouse bear one copy trp 53 gene start develop cancer nine month incidence increase age. study venkatachalam colleague analysed impressive group 217 trp 53 + / − mouse controll genetic background follow fate trp 53 wild-type allele tumour. accord two-hit model be expect tumour copy have be lose inactivated. however turn not be case. half tumour mouse younger 18 month be find have retain wild-type copy trp 53 number increase 85 % mouse older 18 month. two tumour researcher sequenced complete code region remain wild-type allele show be structurally intact. exclude possibility downregulation inactivation level protein expression irradiated tumour-bearing mouse prior sacrifice treatment know increase p 53 protein level posttranslational mechanism. datum show retain wild-type allele tumour be express normally suggest have normal wild-type conformation. next author do rigorous test different function p 53 protein. first test tumour show amplification mdm 2. protein expression be regulate p 53 stimulate breakdown p 53 thereby form negative feedback mechanism keep p 53 level low. tumour therefore amplify mdm 2 gene means inactivate p 53. however be not find tumour trp 53 + / − mouse. subsequently researcher test extent retain trp 53 copy behave normally. irradiation many tissue lead p 53. dependent apoptosis indeed tumour have retain wild-type allele irradiation do lead increase apoptosis tumour have lose wild-type allele do not. p 53 protein be know function transcriptional regulator up- down regulate target gene response different form cellular stress include irradiation-induced dna damage. author study expression two p 53. upregulated gene cdkn 1 encode p 21 mdm one downregulated gene pcna p 53. positive tumour irradiation show response indicative normal p 53 function. furthermore be show p 53 protein tumour be able bind p 53. binding dna sequence vitro setting. finally be know p 53 absence tumour be correlated chromosomal instability venkatachalam al 1998 use comparative genome hybridisation compare feature p 53. negative p 53. positive tumour find 5. fold greater stability latter. short paper clearly show least mouse many trp 53 + / − tumour wild-type allele trp 53 be not only retain also appear function normally. strongly suggest decrease dosage p 53 be already sufficient tumourigenesis phenomenon refer haploinsufficiency. shortly before group moshe oren gottlieb al 1997 have show trp 53 + / − background lead greater 50 % reduction p 53 activity use p 53. responsive lacz reporter gene transgenic mouse. venkatachalam colleague suggest strong concentration dependence p 53 function be explain fact p 53 function tetramer. 50 % decrease p 53 monomer easily be imagine result greater 50 % decrease functional tetramer turn increase chance cell become cancerous. paper venkatachalam al 1998 make realise important be remain critical even long-established theory model. then haploinsufficient mechanism have be describe more tumour suppressor gene human mouse review fodde smit 2002. instance recent paper plo biology trotman al 2003 use mouse model describe dosage pten tumour suppressor gene influence occurrence prostate cancer. further gene have be describe other unexpected role tumourigenic process. be long-standing debate literature number role mutation tumour go detail be clear haploinsufficient mechanism tumour suppressor gene greatly influence statistics discussion be base. time microarray analysis have become standard experiment many thousand change tumour cell be analysed whole genome be important keep mind correct interpretation wealth information be more complicated widely accept model have believe
