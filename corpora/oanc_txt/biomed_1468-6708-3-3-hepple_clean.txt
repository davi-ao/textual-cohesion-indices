three publish [ 1 2 3 ] one recently present [ 4 ] randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial have unequivocally demonstrate 3. hydroxy- 3. methylgluatryl coenzyme hmg coa reductase inhibitor statin reduce morbidity mortality associate coronary disease. trial find compare placebo statin significantly reduce incidence death myocardial infarction unstable angina percutaneous surgical coronary revascularization stroke person stable coronary disease. patient have experience acute coronary syndrome three six month enrollment be exclude trial do not assess effect lipid-lowering therapy adverse cardiovascular event recently unstable coronary disease. lipid-lowering therapy provide incremental benefit initiate immediately follow acute coronary syndrome be important issue risk recurrent adverse cardiac event be much greater patient unstable coronary disease stable setting. myocardial ischemium reduction aggressive cholesterol lowering miracl trial set answer question. miracl enroll 3 086 patient 24. 96 hour mean 63 hour admission unstable angina non- q- wave myocardial infarction randomized 16 week atorvastatin 80 mg placebo once daily [ 5 ]. major exclusion criterion be. total cholesterol level greater 270 mg / dl. q- wave myocardial infarction admission previous month. coronary revascularization month admission index hospitalization anticipate follow hospital discharge. primary efficacy endpoint be composite death non-fatal myocardial infarction resuscitated sudden cardiac death emergent rehospitalization worsen symptomatic myocardial ischemium. secondary endpoint include stroke worsen heart failure need coronary revascularization change lipid level study. average patient be 65 year age approximately 65 % be man 86 % caucasian mean baseline low density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol level be 124 mg / dl. atorvastatin treatment be associate 2 6 % absolute reduction risk primary endpoint 14 8 % v 17 %. rr relative risk [ rr ] 0 84 95 % confidence

patient p &lt; 0 001. efficacy safety finding miracl be unique number reason. lipid-lowering therapy be associate significantly lower mortality initiate early acute coronary syndrome two large observational study [ 6 7 ] miracl be first randomized trial suggest statin confer clinical benefit set. be also first trial identify short-term ie 16 week clinical benefit statin therapy. previous secondary prevention trial benefit statin therapy be not evident one two year. clinical trial safety endpoint be consider less glamorous miracl most important contribution have be high-dose statin therapy be not associate serious harm use unstable setting. earlier secondary prevention statin trial have exclude patient unstable coronary syndrome largely theoretical concern statin-mediated reduction vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation destabilize heal plaque. harm result aggressive treatment strategy allay theoretical fear do so remove major obstacle inpatient initiation lipid-lowing therapy coronary event. unique important finding be number inherent study limitation worth note. foremost possibility null treatment effect cannot be ignore give wide confidence interval hence marginally significant p value 0 048 effect atorvastatin primary efficacy endpoint. furthermore number patient lose follow be small adverse event have occur treat atorvastatin n not placebo n 8 overall trial result have be neutral rather positive. type event prevent miracl be also worth note. rehospitalization recurrent myocardial ischemium be important determinant quality life health care cost other important endpoint be not significantly affect eg death myocardial infarction resuscitated sudden cardiac death worsen heart failure need coronary revascularization etc. question statin prevent other adverse event initiate soon acute coronary syndrome require further study. short duration follow-up be also particularly troubling. be impressive clinical benefit be realize only 16 week statin therapy increase risk adverse clinical event persist year follow acute coronary syndrome. longer clinical follow up be not possible assess intermediate-term effect atorvastatin hard endpoint such death myocardial infarction. do so be critical light lack effect important endpoint 16 week. unfortunately late clinical follow up be plan. be also number limitation have hamper study generalizability. patient undergo recent revascularization be plan be exclude. specifically patient undergo percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ptca coronary artery bypass graft cabg surgery previous three six month respectively be not eligible inclusion. investigator reason recurrent ischemic event population be likely result restenosis bypass graft closure statin be less likely affect process [ 8 ]. nevertheless number trial have establish benefit statin therapy early coronary revascularization [ 9 10 11 ]. furthermore number recent trial have suggest higher risk patient non- st elevation acute coronary syndrome fair better early invasive strategy be apply [ 12 13 14 ] be not uncommon patient be treat fashion. second patient q- wave myocardial infarction be not eligible enrollment be feel statin not influence development important prognostic determinant such leave ventricular systolic dysfunction ventricular arrhythmia mechanical complication [ 5 ]. nevertheless patient develop electrocardiographic q- wave represent substantial proportion patient myocardial infarction. short-term risk follow hospital discharge be lower relative non- q- wave myocardial infarction be still much greater patient stable coronary disease need secondary prevention population be equally important. third high risk nature enroll patient ie electrocardiogram [ ecg ] change / other objective evidence ischemium rate platelet glycoprotein iib / iium inhibitor utilization be quite low 1 %. such therapy appear be cost effective [ 15 16 ] especially high risk patient be recommend current american college cardiology / american heart association guideline [ 17 ]. fourth not be possible ascertain finding apply patient recent acute coronary syndrome regardless baseline lipid level. small difference number primary endpoint event atorvastatin placebo group make difficult dissect relationship baseline lipid level treatment effect further. consequently remain uncertain extrapolate miracl trial result undergo coronary revascularization shortly coronary event present q- wave myocardial infarction be treat platelet glycoprotein iib / iium inhibitor have relatively low admission ldl cholesterol level. miracl two aforementioned cohort study suggest lipid-lowering agent exert short-term clinical benefit initiate soon acute coronary syndrome remain open question. even finding be not confirm further study still make compelling argument lipid-lowering therapy bar contraindication be initiate early universally patient present acute coronary syndrome. first long-term safety effectiveness statin secondary prevention stable coronary disease be well-established [ 1 2 3 ]. second evidence miracl agent be safe initiate time hospitalization acute coronary syndrome. third in-hospital initiation lipid-lowering therapy appear promote greater long-term utilization agent [ 18 19 20 21 ]. finally lipid level be unreliable setting acute coronary syndrome except total. hdl ldl. hdl cholesterol ratio [ 22 ] overwhelming majority patient coronary disease ultimately require pharmacologic non-pharmacologic lipid-lowering intervention attain recommend cholesterol target [ 23 24 25 ]. newer guideline be even more stringent [ 26 ]. furthermore datum recently present heart protection study suggest clinical benefit accrue independent baseline cholesterol level [ 4 ]. thus withhold lipid-lowering therapy patient present acute coronary syndrome be accept status quo date effort cholesterol lower secondary prevention set have be dismal [ 27 28 ]. ascertainment quantification incremental benefit confer statin therapy initiate early acute coronary syndrome require confirmation. be currently only one ongoing randomized placebo-controlled trial early delay statin therapy setting a- 2. z aggrastat zocor merck [ 29 ]. a- 2. z study be evaluate efficacy early treatment simvastatin 4 500 patient follow episode unstable angina non- q wave myocardial infarction. first four month patient be randomized simvastatin 40 mg daily placebo. thereafter patient treat simvastatin first phase receive 80 mg simvastatin daily treat placebo 40 mg simvastatin daily. primary composite endpoint be occurrence cardiovascular death non-fatal myocardial infarction rehospitalization acute coronary syndrome ac one year. a- 2. z demonstrate significant reduction incidence adverse event first four month suggest incremental clinical benefit initiate agent early acute coronary syndrome. benefit accrue do so later follow up be difficult discriminate effect more aggressive v earlier lipid lower therapy. pravastatin atorvastatin evaluation infection therapy prove trial be look 4 000 patient 10 day acute coronary syndrome randomize pravastatin 40 mg atorvastatin 80 mg daily [ 29 ]. patient be observe least 1 5 year occurrence myocardial infarction other cardiovascular event. miracl a- 2. z trial study not assess efficacy early statin therapy acute coronary syndrome. rather examine role more v less aggressive lipid-lowering set. 2002 many consider unethical withhold statin patient establish coronary disease. make unlikely additional placebo-controlled trial be carry area. future secondary prevention study look patient stable unstable disease need address comparative efficacy different statin newer agent assess incremental benefit combination therapy [ 30 ] determine be serum cholesterol floor reduction be unlikely provide further clinical benefit
