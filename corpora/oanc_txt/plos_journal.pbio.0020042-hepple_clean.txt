last few year have see enormous stride ability sequence genome information have pour sequence be quite astonishing. more 150 complete genome sequence now available many laboratory rush microarray analysis proteomic initiative even system biology seem appropriate time consider not just opportunity sequence present also shortcoming. far most serious problem be quality degree completeness annotation genome. most troublesome be large number open reading frame have be identify computer program remain label conserved hypothetical protein occur more one genome simply hypothetical protein appear unique genome question. two category annotated open reading frame often represent more half potential protein-coding region genome. annotation highlight just one portion ignorance information content genome lack fundamental knowledge function so many building block cell. rectify situation be likely undermine many other. omic effort currently underway. here advocate rather straightforward approach address problemâ€”focused initially bacterial genome. contrast numerous proposal big science initiative understand fundamental workings biological organism propose small science relatively low-tech approach have dramatic pay. relatively small investment yield massive amount information greatly enhance current effort use genomic approach study life. initial proposal be direct decipher role hypothetical protein encoded microbial genome involve community-wide approach determine function hypothetical base solid old-fashioned biochemistry. essence idea be undertake interdisciplinary effort couple current bioinformatic capability predict protein function direct exploration experimental laboratory test prediction. encourage consortium bioinformatician produce list conserved hypothetical protein be find multiple genome carry best possible bioinformatic analysis then offer protein biochemical community potential target research function. energize laboratory appropriate expertise participate community-wide effort suggest special program be set one more funding agency laboratory undertake investigation particular protein receive small grant upfront supplement exist grant. completion project identification function receive further supplement grant reward. way hope rally best biochemical talent apply problem determine function wide range new protein. cost such operation be quite minimal bureaucracy review process be equally simple. here be case modest infusion fund greatly enhance ability annotate exist new genome sequence ensure current investment genomic sequence yield richest biological harvest possible. be two key step propose plan. first step be encourage bioinformatician appropriate expertise functional annotation genome form consortium undertake assembly list prime target experimental demonstration function be most valuable. three general class such gene come mind. conserved hypothetical gene. belong set gene have ortholog many other genome function have be experimentally determine case. recent success such gene be illustrate box 1. hypothetical gene. form set gene be predict be protein code lack similar gene other organism genbank. too have assign function. misannotated gene. gene be one function have be assign be good reason believe annotation be incorrect. set target be combine arrange prioritized list be accompany best assessment potential function. priority be base gene be most likely prove broadly informative. instance conserved hypothetical gene occur most genome be higher priority one have only two ortholog. list be public web site target predict function be examine modify alternative additional prediction other group guide future experimentation. function be derive information be present target remove main list. second step be invite experimentalist peruse list find potential gene protein product lie realm expertise use experimental knowledge reagent quickly test function. initially advocate allow laboratory team pick choose list sign study just one open reading frame. recommend allow one laboratory open reading frame initial stage. laboratory wish sign generate short document highlight expertise be suitable particular protein. one-page proposal suffice experimental plan demand. point small panel choose compete effort laboratory choose be give small grant six month carry analysis. be successful delineate function target protein paper be write submit peer review. paper be accept publication then additional sum be allocate supplement laboratory exist grant. six month laboratory have not manage delineate function submit short report describe approach have be try result analysis. be post public web site target then become open analysis other laboratory same condition before. initial list target gene probably be base well-studied experimentally tractable organism such escherichium coli not demand biochemical experiment be do e coli gene. ortholog do so long similarity be sufficiently strong give high expectation function be conserved. fact laboratory happen be already work one homolog program provide add bonus greatly speed work. also encourage biochemical genetic approach never be certain one method be better. list course also include conserved gene not find e coli commonly distribute other genome. particular make pitch include gene mycoplasma genitalium free-living organism fewest gene be most suitable model system in-depth understanding biology. proposal experimental attack hypothetical gene be really very traditional approach become large-scale simply parallel nature implementation. resemble successful approach use european achieve complete sequence saccharomyce cerevisia genome goffeau al 1996. result significantly increase functional knowledge gene microbial genome thus far sequenced. such annotation be immediately applicable ortholog dramatically improve value sequenced genome. turn facilitate ability annotate new genome appear. proposal also reinforce notion overwhelming value bioinformatic be generate hypothesis be test experimentally. enable community join effort also demonstrate science really be collaborative enterprise require contribution not just select few. finally initiative succeed serve suitable model begin more daunting task try annotate function complex eukaryotic genome such human genome
