rna interference rnaus have be call one most have exciting discovery biology last couple decade be first recognize andrew fire al 1998 have quickly become one most powerful indispensable tool molecular biologist toolkit. use short double-stranded rna dsrna molecule rnaus selectively silence essentially gene genome. be ancient mechanism gene regulation find eukaryote as diverse yeast mammal probably play central role controll gene expression eukaryote. lab rnaus be routinely use reveal genetic secret development intracellular signal cancer infection full range other phenomenon. phenomenon hail journal science breakthrough year 2002 break lab lead novel therapy as well. pharmaceutical giant be hop so several biotech company have bet future not everyone be sanguine future rnaus therapy. heart promise powerful therapeutic drug lie exquisite selectivity rnaus. fabled magic bullet rnaus sequence seek destroy target affect other gene. clinical application appear endless. gene expression contribute disease be potential target viral gene oncogene gene responsible heart disease alzheimer disease diabetes more. promise rnaus therapy be long way enter clinic. be prove wunderkind lab date test have be do human only most modest circumscribed success have be demonstrate animal. road clinical success be litter great idea have come cropper way include two other rna-based therapy antisense ribozyme show promise bench have largely stumble reach bedside. be rnaus also likely fall short. be different enough make third try charm. be successful drug molecule overcome long set hurdle. be able be manufacture reasonable cost administer safely conveniently. then even more importantly be stable enough reach target cell be degraded excreted. get cell link up intracellular target exert effect. exert enough effect improve health person take. finally do cause significant toxic effect target nontarget tissue. matter good compound look lab fail clear one hurdle be useless drug. rna-based therapy manufacture have be see soluble problem delivery stability potency have be most significant obstacle. be lot clinical naïveté early day antisense ribozyme accord nassim usman vice president research development sirna therapeutics boulder colorado. compound be push clinic prematurely. sirna begin biotech startup ribozyme pharmaceutical try develop ribozyme treat several condition include hepatitis c. ribozyme be rna molecule sequence structure allow cleave specific target rna molecule see figure. initial result hepatitis c be not inspiring say usman molecule use have low potency short half-life once body. enormous dose viral load be not significantly affect. just do n't have characteristic be drug say. ribozyme have yet be approve use united state food drug administration fda. similarly much initial enthusiasm attempt develop antisense drug have be largely disappointing. antisense be single strand rna dna complementary target messenger rna mrna sequence. pair antisense strand prevent translation mrna see figure. least be theory early clinical result seem support theory. antisense drug effectively reduce tumor size anticancer trial viral load antiviral trial. closer inspection reveal result be largely due increase production interferon immune system response high dose foreign rna rather specific silence target gene. relatively high proportion c–g sequence antisense mimic bacterial viral gene thus trigger immune response. antisense dose be lower prevent interferon response clinical benefit largely disappear as well. thus rather be highly specific therapy antisense seem be general immune system booster. as long patient be get better do matter mechanism be. do n't matter be patient do matter be try develop next drug say cy stein associate professor medicine pharmacology columbium university college physician surgeon new york city. stein have research antisense more decade. get mechanism wrong be not go be able do. date only one antisense drug have receive fda approval. vitravene isis pharmaceutical carlsbad californium be use treat cytomegalovirus infection eye patient hiv. vitravene be actually dna antisense drug bind viral dna though say usman be unclear actually work antisense mechanism. stein express similar skepticism mechanism second antisense drug genasense. genasense be dna-based treatment target bcl- 2 protein express high level cancer cell be think protect standard chemotherapy. fda be currently review application genasense base promising result treatment malignant melanoma. grow disillusionment antisense ribozyme coincide discovery rnaus realization be far more potent way silence gene expression. rnaus usee short dsrna molecule sequence match gene interest. once cell dsrna molecule be cleaved segment approximately 22 nucleotide long call short interfere rna sirna see figure. sirna become bind rna-induced silence complex risc then also bind match mrna sequence. once occur mrna be degraded effectively silence gene come. detail structure function risc be still largely unknown be think act true enzyme complex require only one several sirna molecule degrade many time number match mrna. extraordinary selectivity rnaus combine potency—in theory only few dsrna be need cell—quickly make tool choice functional genomic determine gene product do other product interact drug target discovery validation. knock gene rnaus determine cell respond researcher course only few day develop significant insight function gene determine reduce expression be likely be therapeutically useful. do rnaus have better chance succeed drug antisense ribozyme. fundamental difference favor rnaus be be harness endogenous natural pathway say nagesh mahanthappa director corporate development alnylam pharmaceutical cambridge massachusett second two major biotech company develop rnai-based therapy. exploitation pre-existing mechanism say be main reason rnaus be order magnitude more potent other two type rna strategy. more potent test tube least. stability delivery be also major obstacle successful rnaus therapy obstacle be intrinsic biochemical nature rna as well body defense infection foreign nucleotide. strongest reason n't get away say stein. problem be charge oligonucleotide not pass lipid layer do order enter cell. john rossus director department molecular biology city hope hospital duarte californium have work rna-based therapy 15 year concur. cell do n't want take rna say make evolutionary sense extracellular rna usually signify viral infection. injected bloodstream unmodified rna be rapidly excreted kidney degraded enzyme. solve problem cell penetration most researcher have complexed rna lipid modify rna phosphate backbone minimize charge. mahanthappa think complex approach be unlikely be simple solution drug approval require independent testing lipid delivery system as well. instead alnylam be pursue backbone modification. minimal modification be go be necessary increase cell uptake improve stability blood stream mahanthappa say. have learn antisense field be even other delivery strategy administer rna sufficient dose be stable get take cell. anything be do increase half-life circulation improve delivery say judy lieberman senior investigator center blood research associate professor pediatrics harvard medical school cambridge massachusett. not be only problem caution. lieberman lab recently demonstrate ability rnaus silence expression fa gene mouse protect fulminant hepatitis. fa trigger apoptosis program cell death response variety cell insult. experiment lieberman deliver rna high-pressure injection tail. rna get liver silence fa protect mouse hepatitis. however significant fraction animal die heart failure bring injection volume be 20 % mouse blood volume. such delivery scheme simply not work human. delivery cell be still obstacle lieberman explain. really focus solve problem be not go get very far. even assume delivery problem be solve other question remain include therapeutic level rnaus be toxic. mahanthappa say conservative answer be just do n't know. more aggressive answer be be reason think so. rossus be n't so sure. target interest be normal cell as well cancer cell say. be get toxicity. small rna be deliver target cell efficiently significant toxicity be effective medicine. usman sirna be confident be. get there be one piece doubt mind work say. date numerous experiment animal model suggest rnaus downregulate variety target gene effectively. however be still two unanswered question translate effective therapy. first be rnaus exquisite specificity be really advantage bench. be unclear highly specific drug give big therapeutic effect say cy stein. instance say most active antitumor medicine have multiple mechanism action. more specific make less robust therapeutic activity be likely be. rossus agree. overspecificity have never work say. second question be effect excess rna cell have normal function risc complex heart rnaus mechanism. number risc cell be unknown one concern be amount rna need have therapeutic effect occupy available complex. be usurp natural cell system be there other purpose knock endogenous gene function say rossus. introduction foreign rna system continue perform normal function well become saturate. be big black box field say. question unsolved problem sirna alnylam several other company be move ahead develop rnaus therapy. indeed outstanding question be probably only likely be answer process therapeutic development. first application be likely be cancer target out-of-control oncogene viral infection target viral gene. avoid problem delivery initial trial deliver rna direct injection target tissue tumor instance ex vivo treat white blood cell infect hiv example. have spend decade try develop ribozyme say usman sirna be prepare rough road face. have n't solve problem know proceed work. be surprise us—we have see movie before. usman expect sirna file investigational new drug application fda end 2004 have human clinical trial progress 2005. doubt be rnai-based drug ten year usman predict. stein be n't so sure think too much be still be learn rnaus body reaction be confident rna-based therapy ultimately be successful. whole field be found belief be rational be huge gap knowledge need bit luck be successful say. think people be surprise complicate be be other way. be intellectual conceit think nature be simple
