patient drop ineffective therapy. more discussion be give later. do not know author have intend make latter estimate give wrong summary instead. even more interesting useful be same calculation treatment group comparison estimate. unfortunately paper do not give number dropout accord treatment group. use proportion simplify illustration idea easily be convey estimation continuous datum well such bp exercise time hemodynamic measure lipoprotein level. several point be generalized simple illustration give closer examination other example. • do not take very much miss datum mislead investigator. good principle avoid be mislead be alway account subject randomized study analysis. use total number randomized subject denominator be step accomplish principle be calculate average

subject category withdrawal accord treatment group. reason patient drop be use help properly assess nature miss datum. example dropout be lack response side effect then calculation be appropriate. statistical term be call informative miss datum. be useful information be find reason dropout be use estimate true response. outcome-related dropout be informative not be disregard analytical study careful thought. particular patient die cause death be such example 3 subsequent physiological quality life datum not even be regard miss have value equal zero worst category. patient clinical status have reach terminal disease progression stage such new york heart association class iv be unable perform exercise testing example 3 exercise time also be equal zero seconds not simply regard miss datum. same reason remain survival time death cause be zero day well not censor observation do say kaplan- meier survival analysis endpoint such cardiovascular death. treating non-cardiovascular death equivalent censor loss-to-follow-up end-of-observation endpoint cardiovascular death have unfortunately become popular practice many medical journal article. need be correct. • extreme calculation enable assess uncertainty datum contain miss value especially do calculation treatment group separately. bias see medical publishing industry decision article be choose publication be mirror image dropout problem patient study. former positive study have better chance get publish negative study have higher chance be reject. same be true latter. patient respond treatment tend continue study patient fail respond tend drop prematurely. use only available datum only subgroup complete study lead bias result. approach take consideration account also be bias over-correction. • assumption underlie approach be interesting. particular information be know miss datum be essentially assume dropout be not much different completer. be generally describe statistically miss completely random mcar mean process cause miss datum be not informative parameter be try estimate. good way think mcar be dropout be simple random sample study sample. example mcar include patient have move away study have close late entry patient be administratively censor. have see convenience mcar above illustration. simply use completer get same result. however assumption be valid not be examine carefully individual case. many situation dropout be not same patient population stay trial. mcar certainly be less restrictive assumption. still other less restrictive assumption mcar exist be discuss later. • three estimate give be bias certain extent. have author give detail number dropout category lack response side effect better estimate be derive. • certainly feel more comfortable study conclusion be not alter different approach. sensitivity analysis be actually best way analyze datum presence dropout. medical investigator consult statistician deal miss datum be many possible method available. popular approach be review. datum analysis first consideration be objective analysis. presence dropout be two type question. i be treatment effect dropout. ius be treatment effect presence dropout. question i be concern ideal situation. be also know a question explanatory trial [ 6 ]. be often concern human pharmacological property new drug investigation rather practical usage. regard question ius need further differentiate two situation. patient drop totally study datum be collect withdrawal merely study assign treatment datum still be collect. be miss datum. design trial allow patient be follow end study patient lack compliance then ius be very practical question also know the question pragmatic trial [ 7 ]. prevention study all-cause mortality primary endpoint usually follow design. however other endpoint also be followed-up death such design. recent example be [ 8 ] participant even discontinue treatment lovastatin placebo be contact annually vital status cardiovascular event cancer history. miss datum occur design be highly recommend trial possible. fact itt principle originally aim answer question ius type dropout miss datum occur. however more often not face study patient have withdraw study entirely cause miss datum problem ie type example 1. 5 exception example have demonstrate. patient clinical status do not permit further testing discontinue study treatment type dropout problem be common design flaw be correct. nevertheless problem follow-up datum prevail clinical trial. clinical trial conduct drug registration be possible light international conference harmonization ich. e 9 guideline [ 9 ] datum analysis have address question i ius. analysis illustrate table 2 be method general category imputation. general basic idea imputation be fill miss datum use value base certain model assumption. be method base single imputation method base multiple imputation instead fill single value miss value replace miss value set plausible value represent uncertainty right value impute. attraction imputation be once miss datum be filled-in imputed statistical tool available complete datum be apply. method table 2 be single simple imputation method together be view a multiple simple imputation method oppose proper multiple imputation method discuss. datum table 2 only have one time-point month 6 analysis. longitudinal datum multiple time-point conventional last-observation-carried-forward locf approach be common practice simple imputation. approach be use author example 3 5. attempting follow principle itt account randomized locf method include randomized subject have least one post-therapy observation. locf be popular practitioner be simple put effect misconception be conservative mean work effective treatment group. however imputation method implicitly explicitly assume model miss datum. locf assume unrealistically miss datum patient withdrawal be same last value observe patient. consequence assumption be impute datum give within-subject variability alter sample size. proper multiple imputation pmus method be describe [ 10 ] [ 11 ] use regression model create more one imputed datum set thus provide variability imputation. pmus method have long be preferred approach survey research. popularity have recently gainied clinical trial method become automate commercial computer software [ 12 13 ]. however complexity regression model use pmus be carefully think clinical trial practitioner method assume miss datum process be fully capture regression model employ observe value. assumption be call miss random mar. mar essentially say cause miss datum be dependent observe datum such datum previous visit be independent miss value have be observe. be less restrictive model mcar say miss datum cannot be dependent observe miss datum. design suggest murray findlay [ 14 ] force dropout observe uncontrolled bp usee mar principle. mar mcar condition be meet model-based analysis be appropriately perform base observe datum alone further model miss datum process. imputation method be in-between locf pmus be partial imputation pi improve locf method [ 15 ]. idea method be quite simple. locf one impute miss visit time-point carry last observation forward end study. locf require strong assumption stability more impute more bias introduce assumption stability do not hold. method pi do not alway carry observation end time-point study just far enough balance dropout pattern treatment group. underlie principle be dropout pattern be make almost identical treatment group relative comparison treatment effect be less bias. pi do less imputation be less bias locf assumption stability usually do not hold. simulation result various miss datum process demonstrate potential usefulness pi method use available datum locf [ 15 ]. however more experience be still need test new method practice. other more sophisticated method base statistical model be available [ 16 17 18 ]. technical review be find example [ 19 ] [ 20 ]. general computer program be available put effect so-called informative miss datum set require unique model describe. large class non-parametric method be base rank score observation instead actual value. commonly use non-parametric method clinical trial include wilcoxon signed-rank test mann- whitney test so. example 3 also use ranking method locf secondary analysis. incorporating miss datum method be easily do rank miss datum accord reason withdrawal [ 21 ] longitudinal study case time withdrawal [ 22 ]. example death be give worst rank follow lack efficacy then adverse reaction patient refusal so. same category withdrawal early dropout be give worse rank later dropout. ground rule ranking be set prior unmask treatment code datum analysis avoid be post-hoc. miss datum be replace rank usual testing procedure be carry. one major drawback method be do not provide estimation treatment effect original measurement unit datum be replace rank. method parametric non-parametric require much closer collaboration medical investigator statistician. parametric case observe outcome cannot provide statistical test select miss datum model. case validity various model ranking rule require examination miss datum information strong faith reason give patient withdrawal. still main issue be question method be address. attempt follow itt principle miss datum answer question i hop dropout hypothetically be remove say truly itt design successfully use concurrent treatment intolerable side effect affect efficacy study medication. many believe remove patient dropout process be not plausible clinical practice. case dropout process be outcome interest not nuisance effect. example us federal drug association draft guidance diabetes trial specifically request consideration dropout endpoint [ 23 ]. therefore problem become a composite endpoint issue. be approach take [ 24 25 ] have lately be extend model joint distribution longitudinal time-to-event datum ie time withdrawal [ 26 27 ]. setting compare treatment group two aspect simultaneously. chance duration comply prescribe protocol outcome measure eg mean change systolic blood pressure give pattern compliance. comparison be straightforward standard binomial survival technique. comparison require same care have be discuss here previously because give pattern compliance subgroup patient have already be self-selected. randomization mechanism use achieve comparability treatment group be break post-randomization stratification compliance. be then important check key outcome-correlated baseline characteristic treatment group incomparability subgroup patient. be do example 4 not other. recognizing subgroup be longer randomized treat portion semi-observational study imbedded randomized trial. technique use analyze observational study be apply part comparison [ 28 ]. generally speak observational study bias only be reduce not entirely eliminate method adjustment match. sensitivity analysis approach be consider different baseline covariate match adjustment. issue do miss datum cause dropout clinical trial be research topic be still development statistical literature. have be note ich-e 9 guideline [ 9 ] universally applicable method handle miss value be recommend. issue handle miss datum be intrinsically difficult require large proportion miss datum investigate method. other hand large proportion miss datum make clinical study less credible. best available advice be minimize chance dropout design stage trial monitoring. truly itt design be absolutely encourage. require follow-up datum be collect even patient discontinue treatment clinical status patient permit. be anticipate be many dropout then perhap study duration be shorten. alternatively medical procedure be deem be most likely cause patient withdrawal be alter. datum death cause be give value zero instead blank. consideration also be give define endpoint event instead measurement value primary response variable be determine even patient withdraw study. analysis be clear question objective analysis miss datum conduct sensitivity analysis set plausible pre-specified model miss
